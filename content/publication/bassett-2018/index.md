abstract: 'Network theory provides an intuitively appealing framework for studying
  relationships among interconnected brain mechanisms and their relevance to behaviour.
  As the space of its applications grows, so does the diversity of meanings of the
  term network model. This diversity can cause confusion, complicate efforts to assess
  model validity and efficacy, and hamper interdisciplinary collaboration. In this
  Review, we examine the field of network neuroscience, focusing on organizing principles
  that can help overcome these challenges. First, we describe the fundamental goals
  in constructing network models. Second, we review the most common forms of network
  models, which can be described parsimoniously along the following three primary
  dimensions: from data representations to first-principles theory; from biophysical
  realism to functional phenomenology; and from elementary descriptions to coarse-grained
  approximations. Third, we draw on biology, philosophy and other disciplines to establish
  validation principles for these models. We close with a discussion of opportunities
  to bridge model types and point to exciting frontiers for future pursuits.'
