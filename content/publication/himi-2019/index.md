abstract: Although prior investigations have revealed cognitive abilities to be important
  predictors of multitasking behavior, few investigations have been conducted on the
  relation between executive functions (EFs) and multitasking behavior. The current
  study examines the underlying cognitive constructs associated with the concept of
  multitasking behavior. A sample of 202 young adults completed a battery of EFs (shifting,
  updating, and inhibition), three working memory capacity (WMC) tests, three relational
  integration tests, two divided attention tests, and a multitasking scenario (Simultaneous
  Capacity). First, in direct replication attempts, the results replicated the multitasking
  behavior model (Bühner, König, Pick, & Krumm, 2006) and partially replicated the
  three-factor and nested factors EFs models (Friedman et al., 2016). Second, hierarchical
  multiple regression analyses and relative weight analyses revealed that updating,
  inhibition, relational integration, and divided attention had strong contributions
  in explaining multitasking behavior variance, whereas shifting and WMC did not show
  any explanatory power beyond these constructs. Finally, using structural equation
  modeling, we found that the general EF ability (common EF) representing variance
  common to shifting, updating, and inhibition highly overlapped with multitasking
  behavior. Our results are of value not only to shed light on the relevant cognitive
  correlates of multitasking behavior but also to position multitasking behavior in
  an established framework of cognitive abilities.
