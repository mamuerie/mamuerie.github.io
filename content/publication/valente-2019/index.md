abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has been successfully used
  for Brain Computer Interfacing (BCI) to classify (imagined) movements of different
  limbs. However, reliable classification of more subtle signals originating from
  co-localized neural networks in the sensorimotor cortex, e.g. individual movements
  of fingers of the same hand, has proved to be more challenging, especially when
  taking into account the requirement for high single trial reliability in the BCI
  context. In recent years, Multi Voxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA) has gained momentum
  as a suitable method to disclose such weak, distributed activation patterns. Much
  attention has been devoted to developing and validating data analysis strategies,
  but relatively little guidance is available on the choice of experimental design,
  even less so in the context of BCI-MVPA. When applicable, block designs are considered
  the safest choice, but the expectations, strategies and adaptation induced by blocking
  of similar trials can make it a sub-optimal strategy. Fast event-related designs,
  in contrast, require a more complicated analysis and show stronger dependence on
  linearity assumptions but allow for randomly alternating trials. However, they lack
  resting intervals that enable the BCI participant to process feedback. In this proof-of-concept
  paper a hybrid blocked fast-event related design is introduced that is novel in
  the context of MVPA and BCI experiments, and that might overcome these issues by
  combining the rest periods of the block design with the shorter and randomly alternating
  trial characteristics of a rapid event-related design. A well-established button-press
  experiment was used to perform a within-subject comparison of the proposed design
  with a block and a slow event-related design. The proposed hybrid blocked fast-event
  related design showed a decoding accuracy that was close to that of the block design,
  which showed highest accuracy. It allowed for across-design decoding, i.e. reliable
  prediction of examples obtained with another design. Finally, it also showed the
  most stable incremental decoding results, obtaining good performance with relatively
  few blocks. Our findings suggest that the blocked fast event-related design could
  be a viable alternative to block designs in the context of BCI-MVPA, when expectations,
  strategies and adaptation make blocking of trials of the same type a sub-optimal
  strategy. Additionally, the blocked fast event-related design is also suitable for
  applications in which fast incremental decoding is desired, and enables the use
  of a slow or block design during the test phase.
