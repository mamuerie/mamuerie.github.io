abstract: 'The notion of a saliency-based processing architecture [1] underlying human
  vision is central to a number of current theories of visual selective attention
  [e.g., 2]. On this view, focal-attention is guided by an overall-saliency map of
  the scene, which integrates (sums) signals from pre-attentive sensory feature-contrast
  computations (e.g., for color, motion, etc.). By linking the Posterior Contralateral
  Negativity (PCN) component to reaction time (RT) performance, we tested one specific
  prediction of such salience summation models: expedited shifts of focal-attention
  to targets with low, as compared to high, target-distracter similarity. For two
  feature-dimensions (color and orientation), we observed decreasing RTs with increasing
  target saliency. Importantly, this pattern was systematically mirrored by the timing,
  as well as amplitude, of the PCN. This pattern demonstrates that visual saliency
  is a key determinant of the time it takes for focal-attention to be engaged onto
  the target item, even when it is just a feature singleton.'
