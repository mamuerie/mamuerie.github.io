abstract: Response-related mechanisms of multitasking were studied by analyzing simultaneous
  processing of responses in different modalities (i.e., crossmodal action). Participants
  responded to a single auditory stimulus with a saccade, a manual response (single-task
  conditions), or both (dual-task condition). We used a spatially incompatible stimulus-response
  mapping for one task, but not for the other. Critically, inverting these mappings
  varied temporal task overlap in dual-task conditions while keeping spatial incompatibility
  across responses constant. Unlike previous paradigms, temporal task overlap was
  manipulated without utilizing sequential stimulus presentation, which might induce
  strategic serial processing. The results revealed dual-task costs, but these were
  not affected by an increase of temporal task overlap. This finding is evidence for
  parallel response selection in multitasking. We propose that crossmodal action is
  processed by a central mapping-selection mechanism in working memory and that the
  dual-task costs are mainly caused by mapping-related crosstalk.
