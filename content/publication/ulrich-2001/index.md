abstract: Miller, Patterson, and Ulrich ~ 1998! introduced a jackknife-based method
  for measuring the differences between two conditions in the onset latencies of the
  lateralized readiness potential ~ LRP!. The present paper generalizes such jackknife-based
  methods to factorial experiments with any combination of within- and between subjects
  factors. Specifically, we introduce a subsample scoring method to assess potential
  main and interaction effects on LRP onsets within conventional yet slightly adjusted
  analyses of variance ~ ANOVAs! and post hoc comparison procedures.
