 abstract = {Miller, Patterson, and Ulrich ~ 1998! introduced a jackknife-based method for measuring the differences between two conditions in the onset latencies of the lateralized readiness potential ~ LRP!. The present paper generalizes such jackknife-based methods to factorial experiments with any combination of within- and between subjects factors. Specifically, we introduce a subsample scoring method to assess potential main and interaction effects on LRP onsets within conventional yet slightly adjusted analyses of variance ~ ANOVAs! and post hoc comparison procedures.},
