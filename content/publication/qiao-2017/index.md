abstract: Cognitive flexibility forms the core of the extraordinary ability of humans
  to adapt, but the precise neural mechanisms underlying our ability to nimbly shift
  between task sets remain poorly understood. Recent functional magnetic resonance
  imaging (fMRI) studies employing multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) have shown that
  a currently relevant task set can be decoded from activity patterns in the frontoparietal
  cortex, but whether these regions support the dynamic transformation of task sets
  from trial to trial is not clear. Here, we combined a cued task-switching protocol
  with human (both sexes) fMRI, and harnessed representational similarity analysis
  (RSA) to facilitate a novel assessment of trial-by-trial changes in neural task-set
  representations. We first used MVPA to define task-sensitive frontoparietal and
  visual regions and found that neural task-set representations on switch trials are
  less stably encoded than on repeat trials. We then exploited RSA to show that the
  neural representational pattern dissimilarity across consecutive trials is greater
  for switch trials than for repeat trials, and that the degree of this pattern dissimilarity
  predicts behavior. Moreover, the overall neural pattern of representational dissimilarities
  followed from the assumption that repeating sets, compared with switching sets,
  results in stronger neural task representations. Finally, when moving from cue to
  target phase within a trial, pattern dissimilarities tracked the transformation
  from previous-trial task representations to the currently relevant set. These results
  provide neural evidence for the longstanding assumptions of an effortful task-set
  reconfiguration process hampered by task-set inertia, and they demonstrate that
  frontoparietal and stimulus processing regions support \"dynamic adaptive coding,\"
  flexibly representing changing task sets in a trial-by-trial fashion.SIGNIFICANCE
  STATEMENT Humans can fluently switch between different tasks, reflecting an ability
  to dynamically configure \"task sets,\" rule representations that link stimuli to
  appropriate responses. Recent studies show that neural signals in frontal and parietal
  brain regions can tell us which of two tasks a person is currently performing. However,
  it is not known whether these regions are also involved in dynamically reconfiguring
  task-set representations when switching between tasks. Here we measured human brain
  activity during task switching and tracked the similarity of neural task-set representations
  from trial to trial. We show that frontal and parietal brain regions flexibly recode
  changing task sets in a trial-by-trial fashion, and that task-set similarity over
  consecutive trials predicts behavior.
