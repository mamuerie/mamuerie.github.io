abstract: With the development of digital technology, media multitasking behaviour,
  which is using two or more media simultaneously, has become more commonplace. There
  are two opposing hypotheses of media multitasking with regard to its impact on attention.
  One hypothesis claims that media multitasking can strengthen attention control,
  and the other claims heavy media multitaskers are less able to focus on relevant
  tasks in the presence of distractors. A total of 103 healthy subjects took part
  in this study. We measured the Media Multitasking Index (MMI) and subjects performed
  the continuous performance test. Resting state and oddball task functional MRI were
  conducted to analyse functional connectivity in the dorsal attention network, and
  the degree centrality (DC) was calculated using graph theory analysis. We found
  that the DCs in the dorsal attention network were higher during resting state than
  during the oddball task. Furthermore, the DCs during the task were positively correlated
  with the MMI. These results indicated that the DC reduction from resting state to
  the oddball task in high media multitaskers was attenuated compared with low media
  multitaskers. This study not only reveals more about the neurophysiology of media
  multitasking, but could also indicate brain biomarkers of media multitasking behaviour.
