abstract: BACKGROUND  Recent neuroimaging studies have revealed that putatively unimodal
  regions of visual cortex can be activated during auditory tasks in sighted as well
  as in blind subjects. However, the task determinants and functional significance
  of auditory occipital activations (AOAs) remains unclear.  METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
  FINDINGS  We examined AOAs in an intermodal selective attention task to distinguish
  whether they were stimulus-bound or recruited by higher-level cognitive operations
  associated with auditory attention. Cortical surface mapping showed that auditory
  occipital activations were localized to retinotopic visual cortex subserving the
  far peripheral visual field. AOAs depended strictly on the sustained engagement
  of auditory attention and were enhanced in more difficult listening conditions.
  In contrast, unattended sounds produced no AOAs regardless of their intensity, spatial
  location, or frequency.  CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE  Auditory attention, but not passive
  exposure to sounds, routinely activated peripheral regions of visual cortex when
  subjects attended to sound sources outside the visual field. Functional connections
  between auditory cortex and visual cortex subserving the peripheral visual field
  appear to underlie the generation of AOAs, which may reflect the priming of visual
  regions to process soon-to-appear objects associated with unseen sound sources.
