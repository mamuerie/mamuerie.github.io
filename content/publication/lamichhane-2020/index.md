abstract: 'Working memory (WM) function has traditionally been investigated in terms
  of two dimensions: within-individual effects of WM load, and between-individual
  differences in task performance. In human neuroimaging studies, the N-back task
  has frequently been used to study both. A reliable finding is that activation in
  frontoparietal regions exhibits an inverted-U pattern, such that activity tends
  to decrease at high load levels. Yet it is not known whether such U-shaped patterns
  are a key individual differences factor that can predict load-related changes in
  task performance. The current study investigated this question by manipulating load
  levels across a much wider range than explored previously (N~hspace0pt=~hspace0pt1-6),
  and providing a more comprehensive examination of brain-behavior relationships.
  In a sample of healthy young adults (n~hspace0pt=~hspace0pt57), the analysis focused
  on a distinct region of left lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) identified in prior
  work to show a unique relationship with task performance and WM function. In this
  region it was the linear slope of load-related activity, rather than the U-shaped
  pattern, that was positively associated with individual differences in target accuracy.
  Comprehensive supplemental analyses revealed the brain-wide selectivity of this
  pattern. Target accuracy was also independently predicted by the global resting-state
  connectivity of this LPFC region. These effects were robust, as demonstrated by
  cross-validation analyses and out-of-sample prediction, and also critically, were
  primarily driven by the high-load conditions. Together, the results highlight the
  utility of high-load conditions for investigating individual differences in WM function.'
