abstract: How precisely does the brain predict the sensory consequences of our actions?
  Efference copy is thought to reflect the predicted sensation of self-produced motor
  acts, such as the auditory feedback heard while speaking. Here, we use magnetoencephalographic
  imaging (MEG-I) in human speakers to demonstrate that efference copy prediction
  does not track movement variability across repetitions of the same motor task. Specifically,
  spoken vowels were less accurately predicted when they were less similar to a speaker's
  median production, even though the prediction is thought to be based on the very
  motor commands that generate each vowel. Auditory cortical responses to less prototypical
  speech productions were less suppressed, resembling responses to speech errors,
  and were correlated with later corrective movement, suggesting that the suppression
  may be functionally significant for error correction. The failure of the motor system
  to accurately predict less prototypical speech productions suggests that the efferent-driven
  suppression does not reflect a sensory prediction, but a sensory goal.
