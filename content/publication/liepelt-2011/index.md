abstract: 'This study examines whether an improved intertask coordination skill is
  acquired during extensive dual-task training and whether it can be transferred to
  a new dual-task situation. Participants practised a visual-manual task and an auditory-vocal
  task. These tasks were trained in two groups matched in dual-task performance measures
  before practice: a single-task practice group and a hybrid practice group (including
  single-task and dual-task practice). After practice, the single-task practice group
  was transferred to the same dual-task situation as that for the hybrid practice
  group (Experiment 1), both groups were transferred to a dual-task situation with
  a new visual task (Experiment 2), and both groups were transferred to a dual-task
  situation with a new auditory task matched in task difficulty (Experiment 3). The
  results show a dual-task performance advantage in the hybrid practice group over
  the single-task practice group in the practised dual-task situation (Experiment
  1), the manipulated visual-task situation (Experiment 2), and the manipulated auditory-task
  situation (Experiment 3). In all experiments, the dual-task performance advantage
  was consistently found for the auditory task only. These findings suggest that extended
  dual-task practice improves the skill to coordinate two tasks, which may be defined
  as an accelerated switching operation between both tasks. This skill is relatively
  robust against changes of the component visual and auditory tasks. We discuss how
  the finding of task coordination could be integrated in present models of dual-task
  research.'
