abstract: 'Despite the apparent importance of mental fatigue detection, a reliable
  application is hindered due to the incomprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms
  of mental fatigue. In this paper, we investigated the topological alterations of
  functional brain networks in the theta band (4 - 7 Hz) of electroencephalography
  (EEG) data from 40 male subjects undergoing two distinct fatigue-inducing tasks:
  a low-intensity one-hour simulated driving and a high-demanding half-hour sustained
  attention task [psychomotor vigilance task (PVT)]. Behaviorally, subjects demonstrated
  a robust mental fatigue effect, as reflected by significantly declined performances
  in cognitive tasks prior and post these two tasks. Furthermore, characteristic path
  length presented a positive correlation with task duration, which led to a significant
  increase between the first and the last five minutes of both tasks, indicating a
  fatigue-related disruption in information processing efficiency. However, significantly
  increased clustering coefficient was revealed only in the driving task, suggesting
  distinct network reorganizations between the two fatigue-inducing tasks. Moreover,
  high accuracy (92% for driving; 97% for PVT) was achieved for fatigue classification
  with apparently different discriminative functional connectivity features. These
  findings augment our understanding of the complex nature of fatigue-related neural
  mechanisms and demonstrate the feasibility of using functional connectivity as neural
  biomarkers for applicable fatigue monitoring.'
