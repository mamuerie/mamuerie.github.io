abstract: Most people experience the feeling of mental fatigue on a daily basis. Previous
  research shows that mental fatigue impacts information processing and decision making.
  However, the proximal causes of mental fatigue are not yet well understood. In this
  research, we test the opportunity cost model of mental fatigue, which proposes that
  people become more fatigued when the next-best alternative to the current task is
  higher in value. In 4 preregistered experiments (N = 430), participants repeatedly
  reported their current level of fatigue and chose to perform a paid labor task versus
  an unpaid leisure task. In Study 1, all participants were offered the same labor/leisure
  choice. In Studies 2 and 3, we manipulated the opportunity costs of a labor task
  by varying the value of an alternative leisure task. In Study 4, we manipulated
  the opportunity costs of a labor task by varying the value of that labor task. In
  all studies, we found that people were more likely to choose for leisure as they
  became more fatigued. In Studies 2 through 4, we did not find that the manipulated
  leisure value influenced the amount of fatigue participants experienced nor the
  likelihood to choose for leisure. However, in exploratory analyses, in all studies,
  we found that participants who reported to value the leisure task more got more
  fatigued during labor and less fatigued during leisure. Collectively, these results
  provide cautious support for the opportunity cost model, but they also show that
  cost-benefit analyses relating to labor and leisure tasks are fleeting. (PsycInfo
