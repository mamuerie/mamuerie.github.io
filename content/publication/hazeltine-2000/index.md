abstract: 'Abstract             The flanker task, introduced by Eriksen and Eriksen
  [Eriksen, B. A., & Eriksen, C. W. (1974). Effects of noise letters upon the identification
  of a target letter in a nonsearch task. Perception & Psychophysics, 16, 143-149],
  provides a means to selectively manipulate the presence or absence of response competition
  while keeping other task demands constant. We measured brain activity using functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during performance of the flanker task. In accordance
  with previous behavioral studies, trials in which the flanking stimuli indicated
  a different response than the central stimulus were performed significantly more
  slowly than trials in which all the stimuli indicated the same response. This reaction
  time effect was accompanied by increases in activity in four regions: the right
  ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the supplementary motor area, the left superior
  parietal lobe, and the left anterior parietal cortex. The increases were not due
  to changes in stimulus complexity or the need to overcome previously learned associations
  between stimuli and responses. Correspondences between this study and other experiments
  manipulating response interference suggest that the frontal foci may be related
  to response inhibition processes whereas the posterior foci may be related to the
  activation of representations of the inappropriate responses.'
