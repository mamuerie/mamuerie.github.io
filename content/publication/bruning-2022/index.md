abstract: In multitasking research, a central question revolves around whether humans
  can process tasks in parallel. What \"in parallel\" refers to, however, differs
  between research perspectives and experimental approaches. From a task-level perspective,
  parallel processing can be conceived as to whether complete tasks are processed
  in an overlapping manner and how this impacts task performance. In contrast, a large
  body of literature solely focuses on the central stage of response-selection and
  whether it can run in parallel with other processing stages, an approach we refer
  to as the stage-level perspective. Importantly, although each perspective addresses
  related topics and highlights interindividual differences, they evolved through
  independent lines of research. In 2 experiments, we have taken a first step to investigate
  if individuals' tendencies for an overlapping versus serial processing mode on the
  task level are related to vulnerabilities for task interference on the stage level.
  Individual preferences for either task processing mode were assessed in the task
  switching with preview (TSWP) paradigm. Individuals' vulnerability for task interference
  was assessed with the backward crosstalk effect (BCE) in a classical dual task.
  Our results suggest that individuals who prefer overlapping relative to serial task
  processing at the task level are less vulnerable to task interference during response
  selection, indicated by a smaller BCE. This difference, however, only emerged in
  the second experiment with an increased sample size and with task-stimuli that facilitate
  a bottom-up separation of tasks in the dual-task. (PsycInfo Database Record (c)
