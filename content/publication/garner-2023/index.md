abstract: Humans are able to rapidly perform novel tasks, but show pervasive performance
  costs when attempting to do two things at once. Traditionally, empirical and theoretical
  investigations into the sources of such multitasking interference have largely focused
  on multitasking in isolation to other cognitive functions, characterizing the conditions
  that give rise to performance decrements. Here we instead ask whether multitasking
  costs are linked to the system's capacity for knowledge generalization, as is required
  to perform novel tasks. We show how interrogation of the neurophysiological circuitry
  underlying these two facets of cognition yields further insights for both. Specifically,
  we demonstrate how a system that rapidly generalizes knowledge may induce multitasking
  costs owing to sharing of task contingencies between contexts in neural representations
  encoded in frontoparietal and striatal brain regions. We discuss neurophysiological
  insights suggesting that prolonged learning segregates such representations by refining
  the brain's model of task-relevant contingencies, thereby reducing information sharing
  between contexts and improving multitasking performance while reducing flexibility
  and generalization. These proposed neural mechanisms explain why the brain shows
  rapid task understanding, multitasking limitations and practice effects. In short,
  multitasking limits are the price we pay for behavioural flexibility.
