abstract: 'Neuroimaging studies began using block design and event-related design
  experiments. While providing many insights into brain functions, these fMRI design
  types ignore components of the BOLD signal that can teach us additional elements.
  The development of the mixed block/event-related fMRI design allowed for a fuller
  characterization of nonlinear and time-sensitive neuronal responses: for example,
  the interaction between block and event related factors and the simultaneous extraction
  of transient activity related to trials and block transitions and sustained activity
  related to task-level processing. This review traces the origins of the mixed block/event-related
  design from conceptual precursors to a seminal paper and on to subsequent studies
  using the method. The review also comments on aspects of the experimental design
  that must be considered when attempting to use the mixed block/event-related design.
  When taking into account these considerations, the mixed block/event-related design
  allows fuller utilization of the BOLD signal allowing deeper interpretation of how
  regions of the brain function on multiple timescales.'
