abstract: Numerous studies showed decreased performance in situations that require
  multiple tasks or actions relative to appropriate control conditions. Because humans
  often engage in such multitasking activities, it is important to understand how
  multitasking affects performance. In the present article, we argue that research
  on dual-task interference and sequential task switching has proceeded largely separately
  using different experimental paradigms and methodology. In our article we aim at
  organizing this complex set of research in terms of three complementary research
  perspectives on human multitasking. One perspective refers to structural accounts
  in terms of cognitive bottlenecks (i.e., critical processing stages). A second perspective
  refers to cognitive flexibility in terms of the underlying cognitive control processes.
  A third perspective emphasizes cognitive plasticity in terms of the influence of
  practice on human multitasking abilities. With our review article we aimed at highlighting
  the value of an integrative position that goes beyond isolated consideration of
  a single theoretical research perspective and that broadens the focus from single
  experimental paradigms (dual task and task switching) to favor instead a view that
  emphasizes the fundamental similarity of the underlying cognitive mechanisms across
  multitasking paradigms. (PsycINFO Database Record
