abstract: In a task switching design, we investigated the question whether long-range
  theta coupling primarily reflects top-down control processes. Switch and stay trials
  did not differ with respect to memory load or global working memory (WM) demands.
  The results revealed significantly stronger theta coupling (in a range of 4-7 Hz)
  between prefrontal and posterior regions during switch as compared to stay trials.
  Power differences, reflecting more local effects, were largest in the upper alpha
  band (10-13 Hz) and over posterior brain areas, possibly reflecting long-term memory
  activation. The conclusion of the present study is that long-range coherent oscillatory
  activity in the theta band reflects top-down activation rather than global WM functions.
