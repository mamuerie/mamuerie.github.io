abstract: To date, fMRI research has been concerned primarily with evincing generic
  principles of brain function through averaging data from multiple subjects. Given
  rapid developments in both hardware and analysis tools, the field is now poised
  to study fMRI-derived measures in individual subjects, and to relate these to psychological
  traits or genetic variations. We discuss issues of validity, reliability and statistical
  assessment that arise when the focus shifts to individual subjects and that are
  applicable also to other imaging modalities. We emphasize that individual assessment
  of neural function with fMRI presents specific challenges and necessitates careful
  consideration of anatomical and vascular between-subject variability as well as
  sources of within-subject variability.
