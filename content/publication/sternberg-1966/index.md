abstract: When subjects judge whether a test symbol is contained in a short memorized
  sequence of symbols, their mean reaction-time increases linearly with the length
  of the sequence. The linearity and slope of the function imply the existence of
  an internal serial-comparison process whose average rate is between 25 and 30 symbols
  per second.
