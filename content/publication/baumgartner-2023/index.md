abstract: The past decade has witnessed a proliferation of big team science (BTS),
  endeavours where a comparatively large number of researchers pool their intellectual
  and/or material resources in pursuit of a common goal. Despite this burgeoning interest,
  there exists little guidance on how to create, manage and participate in these collaborations.
  In this paper, we integrate insights from a multi-disciplinary set of BTS initiatives
  to provide a how-to guide for BTS. We first discuss initial considerations for launching
  a BTS project, such as building the team, identifying leadership, governance, tools
  and open science approaches. We then turn to issues related to running and completing
  a BTS project, such as study design, ethical approvals and issues related to data
  collection, management and analysis. Finally, we address topics that present special
  challenges for BTS, including authorship decisions, collaborative writing and team
  decision-making.
