abstract: Estimates of functional connectivity derived from resting-state functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) are sensitive to artefacts caused by in-scanner
  head motion. This susceptibility has motivated the development of numerous denoising
  methods designed to mitigate motion-related artefacts. Here, we compare popular
  retrospective rs-fMRI denoising methods, such as regression of head motion parameters
  and mean white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (with and without expansion
  terms), aCompCor, volume censoring (e.g., scrubbing and spike regression), global
  signal regression and ICA-AROMA, combined into 19 different pipelines. These pipelines
  were evaluated across five different quality control benchmarks in four independent
  datasets associated with varying levels of motion. Pipelines were benchmarked by
  examining the residual relationship between in-scanner movement and functional connectivity
  after denoising; the effect of distance on this residual relationship; whole-brain
  differences in functional connectivity between high- and low-motion healthy controls
  (HC); the temporal degrees of freedom lost during denoising; and the test-retest
  reliability of functional connectivity estimates. We also compared the sensitivity
  of each pipeline to clinical differences in functional connectivity in independent
  samples of people with schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Our results
  indicate that (1) simple linear regression of regional fMRI time series against
  head motion parameters and WM/CSF signals (with or without expansion terms) is not
  sufficient to remove head motion artefacts; (2) aCompCor pipelines may only be viable
  in low-motion data; (3) volume censoring performs well at minimising motion-related
  artefact but a major benefit of this approach derives from the exclusion of high-motion
  individuals; (4) while not as effective as volume censoring, ICA-AROMA performed
  well across our benchmarks for relatively low cost in terms of data loss; (5) the
  addition of global signal regression improved the performance of nearly all pipelines
  on most benchmarks, but exacerbated the distance-dependence of correlations between
  motion and functional connectivity; and (6) group comparisons in functional connectivity
  between healthy controls and schizophrenia patients are highly dependent on preprocessing
  strategy. We offer some recommendations for best practice and outline simple analyses
  to facilitate transparent reporting of the degree to which a given set of findings
  may be affected by motion-related artefact.
