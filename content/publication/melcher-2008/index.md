abstract: The present fMRI study sought to investigate the neural basis of perceiving
  learned action effects and thereby to test for hypotheses based on the ideomotor
  principle. For this purpose, we had subjects undergo a two-phase experimental procedure
  comprising an acquisition and a test phase, the latter administered inside the MR
  scanner. During the acquisition phase, free-choice button presses were contingently
  followed by one of two tones of different pitch which thereby should become \"learned
  action effects\". During the following test phase, subjects were presented with
  the action effects either when in a passive (non-acting) state or when they carried
  out forced-choice button presses. Conform to our expectations, we found evidence
  for a motor effector activation following the passive perception of effect tones
  which elicited activation in the neural motor system (premotor and somatosensory
  cortices, SMA, and cerebellum). Surprisingly, however, this activation was observed
  for left-hand effect tones only, suggesting a basic asymmetry in the impact of ideomotor
  learning. Moreover, we found activation in the posterior prefrontal and temporo-parietal
  cortex in response to action effects during the pursuit of goal-directed action.
  This suggests that action effects attracted special attention and thereby engaged
  selective cognitive control processes to ensure task-appropriate performance. Finally,
  there was reduced premotor activation for response-compatible as compared to response-incompatible
  action effects which can be taken as indication for differential requirements on
  the motor system and thus for behavioral interference and/or facilitation by learned
  action effects.
