abstract: What happens in the brain when we reach or exceed our capacity limits? Are
  there individual differences for performance at capacity limits? We used functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the impact of increases in processing
  demand on selected cortical areas when participants performed a parametrically varied
  and challenging dual task. Low-performing participants respond with large and load-dependent
  activation increases in many cortical areas when exposed to excessive task requirements,
  accompanied by decreasing performance. It seems that these participants recruit
  additional attentional and strategy-related resources with increasing difficulty,
  which are either not relevant or even detrimental to performance. In contrast, the
  brains of the high-performing participants \"keep cool\" in terms of activation
  changes, despite continuous correct performance, reflecting different and more efficient
  processing. These findings shed light on the differential implications of performance
  on activation patterns and underline the importance of the interindividual-differences
  approach in neuroimaging research.
