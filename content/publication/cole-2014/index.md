abstract: Many functional network properties of the human brain have been identified
  during rest and task states, yet it remains unclear how the two relate. We identified
  a whole-brain network architecture present across dozens of task states that was
  highly similar to the resting-state network architecture. The most frequent functional
  connectivity strengths across tasks closely matched the strengths observed at rest,
  suggesting this is an \"intrinsic,\" standard architecture of functional brain organization.
  Furthermore, a set of small but consistent changes common across tasks suggests
  the existence of a task-general network architecture distinguishing task states
  from rest. These results indicate the brain's functional network architecture during
  task performance is shaped primarily by an intrinsic network architecture that is
  also present during rest, and secondarily by evoked task-general and task-specific
  network changes. This establishes a~strong relationship between resting-state functional
  connectivity and task-evoked functional connectivity-areas of neuroscientific inquiry
  typically considered separately.
