abstract: Using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), we studied how distributed visual
  representations in human occipitotemporal cortex are modulated by attention and
  link their modulation to concurrent activity in frontal and parietal cortex. We
  detected similar occipitotemporal patterns during a simple visuoperceptual task
  and an attention-to-working-memory task in which one or two stimuli were cued before
  being presented among other pictures. Pattern strength varied from highest to lowest
  when the stimulus was the exclusive focus of attention, a conjoint focus, and when
  it was potentially distracting. Although qualitatively similar effects were seen
  inside regions relatively specialized for the stimulus category and outside, the
  former were quantitatively stronger. By regressing occipitotemporal pattern strength
  against activity elsewhere in the brain, we identified frontal and parietal areas
  exerting top-down control over, or reading information out from, distributed patterns
  in occipitotemporal cortex. Their interactions with patterns inside regions relatively
  specialized for that stimulus category were higher than those with patterns outside
  those regions and varied in strength as a function of the attentional condition.
  One area, the frontal operculum, was distinguished by selectively interacting with
  occipitotemporal patterns only when they were the focus of attention. There was
  no evidence that any frontal or parietal area actively inhibited occipitotemporal
  representations even when they should be ignored and were suppressed. Using MVPA
  to decode information within these frontal and parietal areas showed that they contained
  information about attentional context and/or readout information from occipitotemporal
  cortex to guide behavior but that frontal regions lacked information about category
  identity.
