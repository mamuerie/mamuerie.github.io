abstract: 'We examined the impact task interruptions have on visuospatial vigilance
  in two experiments. In the first experiment participants were randomly assigned
  to one of three interruptions: participants were given a complete rest (rest), participants
  completed an alphanumeric vigilance task (letter), or participants performed the
  primary vigilance task (continuous). In the second experiment participants were
  randomly assigned to one of the conditions from the first experiment or to two further
  conditions, in which participants (spatial memory) performed a spatial match to
  sample task, or participants (verbal memory) performed a letter match to sample
  task. Vigilance performance post-interruption was best for rest, worst for continuous,
  and varied for the other interruption tasks. Overall, the results suggest the vigilance
  decrement is due to the repeated use of particular executive resources, but there
  may, in addition be domain specific interference when the primary task and activities
  during a break make use of the same resources.'
