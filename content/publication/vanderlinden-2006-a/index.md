abstract: Mental fatigue is a common phenomenon that either results from sustained
  mental effort or that is comorbid to a range of psychological and somatic disorders.
  Important symptoms of mental fatigue comprise cognitive and attentional difficulties,
  which have adverse effects on task performance and on everyday activities. Yet,
  little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms that underlie these effects.
  In the current study, we explore whether sensorimotor gating is one of the cognitive
  mechanisms that is disturbed under fatigue. To test this, we compare prepulse inhibition
  (PPI) between fatigued (n=11) and non-fatigued participants (n=9). Fatigue was induced
  by 90 min of cognitively demanding work. Results showed that, compared to the non-fatigue
  group, fatigued participants displayed significantly reduced levels of PPI after
  the manipulation. These findings are linked to theories about compromised cognitive
  control under fatigue and to recent ideas about the role of dopamine in fatigue
  as well as in the regulation of PPI.
