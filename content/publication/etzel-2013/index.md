abstract: Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) is an increasingly popular approach
  for characterizing the information present in neural activity as measured by fMRI.
  For neuroimaging researchers, the searchlight technique serves as the most intuitively
  appealing means of implementing MVPA with fMRI data. However, searchlight approaches
  carry with them a number of special concerns and limitations that can lead to serious
  interpretation errors in practice, such as misidentifying a cluster as informative,
  or failing to detect truly informative voxels. Here we describe how such distorted
  results can occur, using both schematic illustrations and examples from actual fMRI
  datasets. We recommend that confirmatory and sensitivity tests, such as the ones
  prescribed here, should be considered a necessary stage of searchlight analysis
  interpretation, and that their adoption will allow the full potential of searchlight
  analysis to be realized.
