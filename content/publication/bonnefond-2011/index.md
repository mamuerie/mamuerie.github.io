abstract: We assessed the effects of time-on-task on cognitive control expressed by
  the CRN/Nc and the extent to which motivation modulates this relationship. We utilized
  two groups of participants, who were told that their performance would (evaluation
  condition) or would not (control condition) be evaluated online. Both groups performed
  a version of the Eriksen Flanker Task for 60 min. We observed classical vigilance
  lowering, manifested by a progressive performance decline with time-on-task, in
  the control, but not in the evaluation, condition. In the latter, performance remained
  stable throughout the task. ERP analysis indicated the same interaction in our main
  component of interest, the CRN/Nc, whose amplitude decreased from the first to the
  last period in the control condition but remained stable over time in the evaluation
  condition. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate the impact of
  motivation on monitoring processes as indexed by the correct response negativity,
  in the context of a prolonged task. Vigilance lowering caused by a repetitive and
  prolonged flanker task, results in compromised response control and compromised
  control of correct responses. Our results suggest that alterations in ACC functioning
  may underlie vigilance decline and can be viewed as evidence that the action monitoring
  functions of the ACC can be positively affected by motivation.
