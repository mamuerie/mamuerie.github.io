abstract: Selective visual attention involves dynamic interplay between attentional
  control systems and sensory brain structures. We used event-related functional magnetic
  resonance imaging (fMRI) during a cued spatial-attention task to dissociate brain
  activity related to attentional control from that related to selective processing
  of target stimuli. Distinct networks were engaged by attention-directing cues versus
  subsequent targets. Superior frontal, inferior parietal and superior temporal cortex
  were selectively activated by cues, indicating that these structures are part of
  a network for voluntary attentional control. This control biased activity in multiple
  visual cortical areas, resulting in selective sensory processing of relevant visual
  targets.
