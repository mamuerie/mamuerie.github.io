abstract: Speech comprehension in noisy, multitalker situations poses a challenge.
  Successful behavioral adaptation to a listening challenge often requires stronger
  engagement of auditory spatial attention and context-dependent semantic predictions.
  Human listeners differ substantially in the degree to which they adapt behaviorally
  and can listen successfully under such circumstances. How cortical networks embody
  this adaptation, particularly at the individual level, is currently unknown. We
  here explain this adaptation from reconfiguration of brain networks for a challenging
  listening task (i.e., a linguistic variant of the Posner paradigm with concurrent
  speech) in an age-varying sample of n = 49 healthy adults undergoing resting-state
  and task fMRI. We here provide evidence for the hypothesis that more successful
  listeners exhibit stronger task-specific reconfiguration (hence, better adaptation)
  of brain networks. From rest to task, brain networks become reconfigured toward
  more localized cortical processing characterized by higher topological segregation.
  This reconfiguration is dominated by the functional division of an auditory and
  a cingulo-opercular module and the emergence of a conjoined auditory and ventral
  attention module along bilateral middle and posterior temporal cortices. Supporting
  our hypothesis, the degree to which modularity of this frontotemporal auditory control
  network is increased relative to resting state predicts individuals' listening success
  in states of divided and selective attention. Our findings elucidate how fine-tuned
  cortical communication dynamics shape selection and comprehension of speech. Our
  results highlight modularity of the auditory control network as a key organizational
  principle in cortical implementation of auditory spatial attention in challenging
  listening situations.
