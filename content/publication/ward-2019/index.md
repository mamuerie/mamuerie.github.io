abstract: Multitasking behavior is associated with well-known performance costs, but
  the question of why individuals falter when attempting to manage multiple streams
  of information remains difficult to answer. One reason for this difficulty may be
  that multitasking costs are often characterized by isolating component processes
  that are studied largely independently. In this study, we instead integrate two
  commonly studied substrates of multitasking, task-switching and dual-tasking, within
  the same procedural context. This method allows not only a direct comparison of
  performance costs associated with different demand types but also examination of
  their interaction. We measured functional brain activation in thirty healthy young
  adults as they completed a blockdesign version of the task, observing consistent
  and separable patterns of frontoparietal activation as a function of demand type.
  Broadly, task-switching was associated with activation of left premotor and inferior
  parietal regions, and dual-tasking was associated with activation in regions of
  right prefrontal and inferior parietal cortex. In the interaction condition, we
  observed a distributed bilateral pattern of activation across the areas associated
  with each demand in isolation. These results provide both behavioral and neuroimaging
  evidence that task-switching and dual-tasking demands can be dissociated and contribute
  to multitasking costs in unique and separable ways.
