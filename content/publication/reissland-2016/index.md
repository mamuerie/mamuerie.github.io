abstract: Understanding the mechanisms and performance consequences of multitasking
  has long been in focus of scientific interest, but has been investigated by three
  research lines more or less isolated from each other. Studies in the fields of the
  psychological refractory period, task switching, and interruptions have scored with
  a high experimental control, but usually do not give participants many degrees of
  freedom to self-organize the processing of two concurrent tasks. Individual strategies
  as well as their impact on efficiency have mainly been neglected. Self-organized
  multitasking has been investigated in the field of human factors, but primarily
  with respect to overall performance without detailed investigation of how the tasks
  are processed. The current work attempts to link aspects of these research lines.
  All of them, explicitly or implicitly, provide hints about an individually preferred
  type of task organization, either more cautious trying to work strictly serially
  on only one task at a time or more daring with a focus on task interleaving and,
  if possible, also partially overlapping (parallel) processing. In two experiments
  we investigated different strategies of task organization and their impact on efficiency
  using a new measure of overall multitasking efficiency. Experiment 1 was based on
  a classical task switching paradigm with two classification tasks, but provided
  one group of participants with a stimulus preview of the task to switch to next,
  enabling at least partial overlapping processing. Indeed, this preview led to a
  reduction of switch costs and to an increase of dual-task efficiency, but only for
  a subgroup of participants. They obviously exploited the possibility of overlapping
  processing, while the others worked mainly serially. While task-sequence was externally
  guided in the first experiment, Experiment 2 extended the approach by giving the
  participants full freedom of task organization in concurrent performance of the
  same tasks. Fine-grained analyses of response scheduling again revealed individual
  differences regarding the preference for strictly serial processing vs. some sort
  of task interleaving and overlapping processing. However, neither group showed a
  striking benefit in dual-task efficiency, although the results show that the costs
  of multitasking can partly be compensated by overlapping processing.
