abstract: After continuous and prolonged cognitive workload, people typically show
  reduced behavioral performance and increased feelings of fatigue, which are known
  as \"time-on-task (TOT) effects\". Although TOT effects are pervasive in modern
  life, their underlying neural mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we induced
  TOT effects by administering a 20-min continuous psychomotor vigilance test (PVT)
  to a group of 16 healthy adults and used resting-state blood oxygen level-dependent
  (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine spontaneous brain
  activity changes associated with fatigue and performance. Behaviorally, subjects
  displayed robust TOT effects, as reflected by increasingly slower reaction times
  as the test progressed and higher self-reported mental fatigue ratings after the
  20-min PVT. Compared to pre-test measurements, subjects exhibited reduced amplitudes
  of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in the default mode network (DMN) and increased
  ALFF in the thalamus after the test. Subjects also exhibited reduced anti-correlations
  between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and right middle prefrontal cortex
  after the test. Moreover, pre-test resting ALFF in the PCC and medial prefrontal
  cortex (MePFC) predicted subjects' subsequent performance decline; individuals with
  higher ALFF in these regions exhibited more stable reaction times throughout the
  20-min PVT. These results support the important role of both task-positive and task-negative
  networks in mediating TOT effects and suggest that spontaneous activity measured
  by resting-state BOLD fMRI may be a marker of mental fatigue.
