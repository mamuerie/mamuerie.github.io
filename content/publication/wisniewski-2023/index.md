abstract: 'The neural mechanisms of how frontal and parietal brain regions support
  flexible adaptation of behavior remain poorly understood. Here, we used functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and representational similarity analysis (RSA)
  to investigate frontoparietal representations of stimulus information during visual
  classification under varying task demands. Based on prior research, we predicted
  that increasing perceptual task difficulty should lead to adaptive changes in stimulus
  coding: task-relevant category information should be stronger, while task-irrelevant
  exemplar-level stimulus information should become weaker, reflecting a focus on
  the behaviorally relevant category information. Counter to our expectations, however,
  we found no evidence for adaptive changes in category coding. We did find weakened
  coding at the exemplar-level within categories however, demonstrating that task-irrelevant
  information is de-emphasized in frontoparietal cortex. These findings reveal adaptive
  coding of stimulus information at the exemplar-level, highlighting how frontoparietal
  regions might support behavior even under challenging conditions.'
