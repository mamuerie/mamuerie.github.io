abstract: 'Humans are remarkably limited in: (i) how many control-dependent tasks
  they can execute simultaneously, and (ii) how intensely they can focus on a single
  task. These limitations are universal assumptions of most theories of cognition.
  Yet, a rationale for why humans are subject to these constraints remains elusive.
  This feature review draws on recent insights from psychology, neuroscience, and
  machine learning, to suggest that constraints on cognitive control may result from
  a rational adaptation to fundamental, computational dilemmas in neural architectures.
  The reviewed literature implies that limitations in multitasking may result from
  a trade-off between learning efficacy and processing efficiency and that limitations
  in the intensity of commitment to a single task may reflect a trade-off between
  cognitive stability and flexibility.'
