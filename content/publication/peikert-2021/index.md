abstract: Computational reproducibility is the ability to obtain identical results
  from the same data with the same computer code. It is a building block for transparent
  and cumulative science because it enables the originator and other researchers,
  on other computers and later in time, to reproduce and thus understand how results
  came about, while avoiding a variety of errors that may lead to erroneous reporting
  of statistical and computational results. In this tutorial, we demonstrate how the
  R package repro supports researchers in creating fully computationally reproducible
  research projects with tools from the software engineering community. Building upon
  this notion of fully automated reproducibility, we present several applications
  including the preregistration of research plans with code (Preregistration as Code,
  PAC). PAC eschews all ambiguity of traditional preregistration and offers several
  more advantages. Making technical advancements that serve reproducibility more widely
  accessible for researchers holds the potential to innovate the research process
  and to help it become more productive, credible, and reliable.
