abstract: The effects of mental fatigue on the availability of cognitive resources
  and associated response-related processes were examined using event-related brain
  potentials. Subjects performed a Go/NoGo task for 60 min. Reaction time, number
  of errors, and mental fatigue scores all significantly increased with time spent
  on the task. The NoGo-P3 amplitude significantly decreased with time on task, but
  the Go-P3 amplitude was not modulated. The amplitude of error-related negativity
  (Ne/ERN) also decreased with time on task. These results indicate that mental fatigue
  attenuates resource allocation and error monitoring for NoGo stimuli. The Go- and
  NoGo-P3 latencies both increased with time on task, indicative of a delay in stimulus
  evaluation time due to mental fatigue. NoGo-N2 latency increased with time on task,
  but NoGo-N2 amplitude was not modulated. The amplitude of response-locked lateralized
  readiness potential (LRP) significantly decreased with time on task. Mental fatigue
  appears to slows down the time course of response inhibition, and impairs the intensity
  of response execution.
