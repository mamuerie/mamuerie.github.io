 abstract = {Many reaction time (RT) researchers truncate their data sets, excluding as spurious all RTs falling outside a prespecified range. Such truncation can introduce bias because extreme but valid RTs may be excluded. This article examines biasing effects of truncation under various assumptions about the underlying distributions of valid and spurious RTs. For the mean, median, standard deviation, and skewness of RT, truncation bias is larger than some often-studied experimental effects. Truncation can also seriously distort linear relations between RT and an independent variable, additive RT patterns in factorial designs, and hazard functions, but it has little effect on statistical power. The authors report a promising maximum likelihood procedure for estimating properties of an untruncated distribution from a truncated sample and present in an appendix a set of procedures to control for truncation biases when testing hypotheses.},
