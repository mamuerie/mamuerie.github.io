abstract: Many reaction time (RT) researchers truncate their data sets, excluding
  as spurious all RTs falling outside a prespecified range. Such truncation can introduce
  bias because extreme but valid RTs may be excluded. This article examines biasing
  effects of truncation under various assumptions about the underlying distributions
  of valid and spurious RTs. For the mean, median, standard deviation, and skewness
  of RT, truncation bias is larger than some often-studied experimental effects. Truncation
  can also seriously distort linear relations between RT and an independent variable,
  additive RT patterns in factorial designs, and hazard functions, but it has little
  effect on statistical power. The authors report a promising maximum likelihood procedure
  for estimating properties of an untruncated distribution from a truncated sample
  and present in an appendix a set of procedures to control for truncation biases
  when testing hypotheses.
