abstract: The multiple testing problem arises not only when there are many voxels
  or vertices in an image representation of the brain, but also when multiple contrasts
  of parameter estimates (that represent hypotheses) are tested in the same general
  linear model. We argue that a correction for this multiplicity must be performed
  to avoid excess of false positives. Various methods for correction have been proposed
  in the literature, but few have been applied to brain imaging. Here we discuss and
  compare different methods to make such correction in different scenarios, showing
  that one classical and well known method is invalid, and argue that permutation
  is the best option to perform such correction due to its exactness and flexibility
  to handle a variety of common imaging situations.
