abstract: The prevalence and the efficiency of serial and parallel processing under
  multiple task demands are highly debated. In the present study, we investigated
  whether individual preferences for serial or overlapping (parallel) processing represent
  a permanent predisposition or depend on the risk of crosstalk between tasks. Two
  groups (n~=~91) of participants were tested. One group performed a classical task
  switching paradigm, enforcing a strict serial processing of tasks. The second group
  of participants performed the same tasks in a task-switching-with-preview paradigm,
  recently introduced by Reissland and Manzey (2016), which in principle allows for
  overlapping processing of both tasks in order to compensate for switch costs. In
  one condition, the tasks included univalent task stimuli, whereas in the other bivalent
  stimuli were used, increasing risk of crosstalk and task confusion in case of overlapping
  processing. The general distinction of voluntarily occurring preferences for serial
  or overlapping processing when performing task switching with preview could be confirmed.
  Tracking possible processing mode adjustments between low- and high-crosstalk conditions
  showed that individuals identified as serial processors in the low-crosstalk condition
  persisted in their processing mode. In contrast, overlapping processors split up
  in a majority adjusting to a serial processing mode and a minority persisting in
  overlapping processing, when working with bivalent stimuli. Thus, the voluntarily
  occurring preferences for serial or overlapping processing seem to depend at least
  partially on the risk of crosstalk between tasks. Strikingly, in both crosstalk
  conditions the individual performance efficiency was the higher, the more they processed
  in parallel.
