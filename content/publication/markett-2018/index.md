abstract: The functional connectome represents a comprehensive network map of functional
  connectivity throughout the human brain. To date, the relationship between the organization
  of functional connectivity and cognitive performance measures is still poorly understood.
  In the present study we use resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
  (fMRI) data to explore the link between the functional connectome and working memory
  capacity in an individual differences design. Working memory capacity, which refers
  to the maximum amount of context information that an individual can retain in the
  absence of external stimulation, was assessed outside the MRI scanner and estimated
  based on behavioral data from a change detection task. Resting-state time series
  were analyzed by means of voxelwise degree and eigenvector centrality mapping, which
  are data-driven network analytic approaches for the characterization of functional
  connectivity. We found working memory capacity to be inversely correlated with both
  centrality in the right intraparietal sulcus. Exploratory analyses revealed that
  this relationship was putatively driven by an increase in negative connectivity
  strength of the structure. This resting-state connectivity finding fits previous
  task based activation studies that have shown that this area responds to manipulations
  of working memory load.
