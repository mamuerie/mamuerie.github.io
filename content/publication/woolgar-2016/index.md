abstract: How is the processing of task information organized in the brain? Many views
  of brain function emphasize modularity, with different regions specialized for processing
  different types of information. However, recent accounts also highlight flexibility,
  pointing especially to the highly consistent pattern of frontoparietal activation
  across many tasks. Although early insights from functional imaging were based on
  overall activation levels during different cognitive operations, in the last decade
  many researchers have used multivoxel pattern analyses to interrogate the representational
  content of activations, mapping out the brain regions that make particular stimulus,
  rule, or response distinctions. Here, we drew on 100 searchlight decoding analyses
  from 57 published papers to characterize the information coded in different brain
  networks. The outcome was highly structured. Visual, auditory, and motor networks
  predominantly (but not exclusively) coded visual, auditory, and motor information,
  respectively. By contrast, the frontoparietal multiple-demand network was characterized
  by domain generality, coding visual, auditory, motor, and rule information. The
  contribution of the default mode network and voxels elsewhere was minor. The data
  suggest a balanced picture of brain organization in which sensory and motor networks
  are relatively specialized for information in their own domain, whereas a specific
  frontoparietal network acts as a domain-general \"core\" with the capacity to code
  many different aspects of a task.
