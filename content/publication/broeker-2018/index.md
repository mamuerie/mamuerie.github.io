abstract: Performance decrements in multitasking have been explained by limitations
  in cognitive capacity, either modelled as static structural bottlenecks or as the
  scarcity of overall cognitive resources that prevent humans, or at least restrict
  them, from processing two tasks at the same time. However, recent research has shown
  that individual differences, flexible resource allocation, and prioritization of
  tasks cannot be fully explained by these accounts. We argue that understanding human
  multitasking as a choice and examining multitasking performance from the perspective
  of judgment and decision-making (JDM), may complement current dual-task theories.
  We outline two prominent theories from the area of JDM, namely Simple Heuristics
  and the Decision Field Theory, and adapt these theories to multitasking research.
  Here, we explain how computational modelling techniques and decision-making parameters
  used in JDM may provide a benefit to understanding multitasking costs and argue
  that these techniques and parameters have the potential to predict multitasking
  behavior in general, and also individual differences in behavior. Finally, we present
  the one-reason choice metaphor to explain a flexible use of limited capacity as
  well as changes in serial and parallel task processing. Based on this newly combined
  approach, we outline a concrete interdisciplinary future research program that we
  think will help to further develop multitasking research.
