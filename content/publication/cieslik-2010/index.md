abstract: Speed and accuracy of motor responses to lateralized stimuli are influenced
  by the spatial overlap between stimulus location and required response. Responses
  showing high spatial overlap with peripheral cues benefit from a bottom-up driven
  enhancement of attention to the respective location, whereas low overlap requires
  top-down modulated reorienting of resources. Here we investigated the interaction
  between these two processes using a spatial stimulus-response compatibility task.
  Subjects had to react to lateralized visual stimuli with a button press using either
  the ipsilateral (congruent condition) or the contralateral (incongruent condition)
  index finger. Stimulus-driven bottom-up processes were associated with significant
  contralateral activation in V5, the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and the premotor
  cortex (PMC). Incongruent versus congruent responses evoked significant activation
  in bilateral IPS and PMC, highly overlapping with the activations found for stimulus-driven
  bottom-up processes, as well as additional activation in bilateral anterior insula
  and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ).
  Moreover, a region anterior to the bottom-up driven activation in the IPS was associated
  with top-down modulated directionality-specific reorienting of motor attention during
  incongruent motor responses. Based on these results, we propose that stimulus-driven
  activation of contralateral IPS and PMC represent key neuronal substrates for the
  behavioral advantage observed when reacting toward a congruently lateralized stimulus.
  Additional activation in bilateral insula and right DLPFC and TPJ during incongruent
  responses should reflect top-down control mechanisms mediating contextual (i.e.,
  task) demands. Furthermore, this study provides evidence for both overlapping and
  disparate substrates of bottom-up and top-down modulated attentional processes in
  the IPS.
