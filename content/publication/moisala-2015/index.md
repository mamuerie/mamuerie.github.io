abstract: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we measured brain activity
  of human participants while they performed a sentence congruence judgment task in
  either the visual or auditory modality separately, or in both modalities simultaneously.
  Significant performance decrements were observed when attention was divided between
  the two modalities compared with when one modality was selectively attended. Compared
  with selective attention (i.e., single tasking), divided attention (i.e., dual-tasking)
  did not recruit additional cortical regions, but resulted in increased activity
  in medial and lateral frontal regions which were also activated by the component
  tasks when performed separately. Areas involved in semantic language processing
  were revealed predominantly in the left lateral prefrontal cortex by contrasting
  incongruent with congruent sentences. These areas also showed significant activity
  increases during divided attention in relation to selective attention. In the sensory
  cortices, no crossmodal inhibition was observed during divided attention when compared
  with selective attention to one modality. Our results suggest that the observed
  performance decrements during dual-tasking are due to interference of the two tasks
  because they utilize the same part of the cortex. Moreover, semantic dual-tasking
  did not appear to recruit additional brain areas in comparison with single tasking,
  and no crossmodal inhibition was observed during intermodal divided attention.
