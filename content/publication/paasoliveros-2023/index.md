abstract: Crosstalk between conflicting response codes contributes to interference
  in dual-tasking, an effect exacerbated in advanced age. Here, we investigated (i)
  brain activity correlates of such response-code conflicts, (ii) activity modulations
  by individual dual-task performance and related cognitive abilities, (iii) task-modulated
  connectivity within the task network, and (iv) age-related differences in all these
  aspects. Young and older adults underwent fMRI while responding to the pitch of
  tones through spatially mapped speeded button presses with one or two hands concurrently.
  Using opposing stimulus-response mappings between hands, we induced conflict between
  simultaneously activated response codes. These response-code conflicts elicited
  activation in key regions of the multiple-demand network. While thalamic and parietal
  areas of the conflict-related network were modulated by attentional, working-memory
  and task-switching abilities, efficient conflict resolution in dual-tasking mainly
  relied on increasing supplementary motor activity. Older adults showed non-compensatory
  hyperactivity in left superior frontal gyrus, and higher right premotor activity
  was modulated by working-memory capacity. Finally, connectivity between premotor
  or parietal seed regions and the conflict-sensitive network was neither conflict-specific
  nor age-sensitive. Overall, resolving dual-task response-code conflict recruited
  substantial parts of the multiple-demand network, whose activity and coupling, however,
  were only little affected by individual differences in task performance or age.
