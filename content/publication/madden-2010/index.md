abstract: Task switching requires executive control processes that undergo age-related
  decline. Previous neuroimaging studies have identified age-related differences in
  brain activation associated with global switching effects (dual-task blocks versus
  single-task blocks), but age-related differences in activation during local switching
  effects (switch trials versus repeat trials, within blocks) have not been investigated.
  This experiment used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and diffusion
  tensor imaging (DTI), to examine adult age differences in task switching across
  adjacent trials (i.e., local task switching). During fMRI scanning, participants
  performed a cued, word categorization task. From interspersed cue-only trials, switch-related
  processing associated with the cue was estimated separately from the target. Activation
  associated with task switching, within a distributed frontoparietal network, differed
  for cue- and target-related processing. The magnitude of event-related activation
  for task switching was similar for younger adults (n=20; 18-27years) and older adults
  (n=20; 60-85years), although activation sustained throughout the on-tasks periods
  exhibited some age-related decline. Critically, the functional connectivity of switch-related
  regions, during cue processing, was higher for younger adults than for older adults,
  whereas functional connectivity during target processing was comparable across the
  age groups. Further, individual differences in cue-related functional connectivity
  shared a substantial portion of the age-related variability in the efficiency of
  target categorization response (drift rate). This age-related difference in functional
  connectivity, however, was independent of white matter integrity within task-relevant
  regions. These findings highlight the functional connectivity of frontoparietal
  activation as a potential source of age-related decline in executive control.
