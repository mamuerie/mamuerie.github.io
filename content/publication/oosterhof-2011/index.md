abstract: For functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), multi-voxel pattern analysis
  (MVPA) has been shown to be a sensitive method to detect areas that encode certain
  stimulus dimensions. By moving a searchlight through the volume of the brain, one
  can continuously map the information content about the experimental conditions of
  interest to the brain. Traditionally, the searchlight is defined as a volume sphere
  that does not take into account the anatomy of the cortical surface. Here we present
  a method that uses a cortical surface reconstruction to guide voxel selection for
  information mapping. This approach differs in two important aspects from a volume-based
  searchlight definition. First, it uses only voxels that are classified as grey matter
  based on an anatomical scan. Second, it uses a surface-based geodesic distance metric
  to define neighbourhoods of voxels, and does not select voxels across a sulcus.
  We study here the influence of these two factors onto classification accuracy and
  onto the spatial specificity of the resulting information map. In our example data
  set, participants pressed one of four fingers while undergoing fMRI. We used MVPA
  to identify regions in which local fMRI patterns can successfully discriminate which
  finger was moved. We show that surface-based information mapping is a more sensitive
  measure of local information content, and provides better spatial selectivity. This
  makes surface-based information mapping a useful technique for a data-driven analysis
  of information representation in the cerebral cortex.
