abstract: Artifactual sources of resting-state (RS) FMRI can originate from head motion,
  physiology, and hardware. Of these sources, motion has received considerable attention
  and was found to induce corrupting effects by differentially biasing correlations
  between regions depending on their distance. Numerous corrective approaches have
  relied on the identification and censoring of high-motion time points and the use
  of the brain-wide average time series as a nuisance regressor to which the data
  are orthogonalized (Global Signal Regression, GSReg). We first replicate the previously
  reported head-motion bias on correlation coefficients using data generously contributed
  by Power et al. (2012). We then show that while motion can be the source of artifact
  in correlations, the distance-dependent bias-taken to be a manifestation of the
  motion effect on correlation-is exacerbated by the use of GSReg. Put differently,
  correlation estimates obtained after GSReg are more susceptible to the presence
  of motion and by extension to the levels of censoring. More generally, the effect
  of motion on correlation estimates depends on the preprocessing steps leading to
  the correlation estimate, with certain approaches performing markedly worse than
  others. For this purpose, we consider various models for RS FMRI preprocessing and
  show that WMeLOCAL, as subset of the ANATICOR discussed by Jo et al. (2010), denoising
  approach results in minimal sensitivity to motion and reduces by extension the dependence
  of correlation results on censoring.
