abstract: Lateralized readiness potentials (LRPs) were used to determine the stage(s)
  of reaction time (RT) responsible for speed-accuracy trade-offs (SATs). Speeded
  decisions based on several types of information were examined in 3 experiments,
  involving, respectively, a line discrimination task, lexical decisions, and an Erikson
  flanker task. Three levels of SAT were obtained in each experiment by adjusting
  response deadlines with an adaptive tracking algorithm. Speed stress affected the
  duration of RT stages both before and after the start of the LRP in all experiments.
  The latter effect cannot be explained by guessing strategies, by variations in response
  force, or as an indirect consequence of the pre-LRP effect. Contrary to most models,
  it suggests that SAT can occur at a late postdecisional stage.
