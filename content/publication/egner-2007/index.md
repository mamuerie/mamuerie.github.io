abstract: 'To ensure optimal task performance, the human brain detects and resolves
  conflict in information processing via a cognitive control system. However, it is
  not known whether conflict resolution relies on a single central resource of cognitive
  control, or on a collection of independent control mechanisms that deal with different
  types of conflict. In order to address this question, we assessed behavioral and
  blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses during the simultaneous detection
  and resolution of two sources of conflict in a modified color-naming Stroop task:
  conflict stemming from incompatibility between the task-relevant and an irrelevant
  stimulus feature (stimulus-based or Stroop conflict), and conflict stemming from
  incompatibility between an irrelevant stimulus feature and response features (response-based
  or Simon conflict). Results show that control mechanisms recruited by stimulus-based
  conflict resolve stimulus-based conflict, but do not affect the resolution of response-based
  conflict, and vice versa. The resolution of response-based conflict was distinguished
  by modulation of activity in premotor cortex, whereas resolution of stimulus-based
  conflict was distinguished by the modulation of activity in parietal cortex. These
  results suggest that the human brain flexibly adopts, and independently controls,
  conflict-specific resolution strategies, biasing motor programming to resolve response-based
  conflict, and biasing stimulus representations to resolve stimulus-based conflict.
  We propose a non-centralized, modular architecture of cognitive control, where separate
  control resources operate in parallel, and are recruited in a context-sensitive
  manner.'
