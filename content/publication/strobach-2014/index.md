abstract: "Improvements in performing demanding and complex task situations are typically
  related to the optimization of executive functions and efficient behavioral control.
  The present study systematizes and reviews the optimization of different executive
  function types: Shifting, Inhibition, Updating, and Dual tasking. In particular,
  we focus on optimisations of these functions with training and on transfer effects
  of related training skills to non-trained situations. The aim of the study's empirical
  part (see also Appendix) was to investigate the specific mechanisms of executive
  functions in the context of Dual tasking, leading to improved dual-task performance
  after practice. More specifically, we tested the Efficient Task Instantiation (ETI)
  model that includes specific assumptions regarding practice-related improvements
  of executive task coordination skills: Dual-task performance is improved with practice
  because of an efficient and conjoint instantiation of sets of relevant task information
  in working memory at the onset of a dual task. According to our knowledge, the ETI
  model is one of the first that allows illustrating the contribution of cognitive
  mechanisms underlying practice-related improvements in performing dual tasks and
  the impact of task coordination skills on this performance."
