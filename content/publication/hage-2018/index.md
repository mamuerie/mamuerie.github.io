abstract: Monkey vocalization is a complex behavioral pattern, which is flexibly used
  in audio-vocal communication. A recently proposed dual neural network model suggests
  that cognitive control might be involved in this behavior, originating from a frontal
  cortical network in the prefrontal cortex and mediated via projections from the
  rostral portion of the ventral premotor cortex (PMvr) and motor cortex to the primary
  vocal motor network in the brainstem. For the rapid adjustment of vocal output to
  external acoustic events, strong interconnections between vocal motor and auditory
  sites are needed, which are present at cortical and subcortical levels. However,
  the role of the PMvr in audio-vocal integration processes remains unclear. In the
  present study, single neurons in the PMvr were recorded in rhesus monkeys (Macaca
  mulatta) while volitionally producing vocalizations in a visual detection task or
  passively listening to monkey vocalizations. Ten percent of randomly selected neurons
  in the PMvr modulated their discharge rate in response to acoustic stimulation with
  species-specific calls. More than four-fifths of these auditory neurons showed an
  additional modulation of their discharge rates either before and/or during the monkeys'
  motor production of the vocalization. Based on these audio-vocal interactions, the
  PMvr might be well positioned to mediate higher order auditory processing with cognitive
  control of the vocal motor output to the primary vocal motor network. Such audio-vocal
  integration processes in the premotor cortex might constitute a precursor for the
  evolution of complex learned audio-vocal integration systems, ultimately giving
  rise to human speech.
