abstract: 'Brain mechanisms linked to incorrect response selections made under time
  pressure during cognitive task performance are poorly understood, particularly in
  adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Using subject-specific
  multimodal imaging (electroencephalogram, magnetic resonance imaging, behavior)
  during flanker task performance by a sample of 94 human adolescents (mean age~=~15.5~years,
  50% female) with varying degrees of ADHD symptomatology, we examined the degree
  to which amplitude features of source-resolved event-related potentials (ERPs) from
  brain-independent component processes within a critical (but often ignored) period
  in the action selection process, the stimulus-response interval, were associated
  with motor response errors (across trials) and error rates (across individuals).
  Response errors were typically preceded by two smaller peaks in both trial-level
  and trial-averaged ERP projections from posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC):
  a frontocentral P3 peaking about 390~ms after stimulus onset, and a premovement
  positivity (PMP) peaking about 110~ms before the motor response. Separating overlapping
  stimulus-locked and response-locked ERP contributions using a \"regression ERP\"
  approach showed that trial errors and participant error rates were primarily associated
  with smaller PMP, and not with frontocentral P3. Moreover, smaller PMP mediated
  the association between larger numbers of errors and ADHD symptoms, suggesting the
  possible value of using PMP as an intervention target to remediate performance deficits
  in ADHD.'
