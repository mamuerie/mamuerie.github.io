abstract: It is well established that reaction time (RT) is shorter when a response
  signal is preceded by a warning signal, because the warning signal causes the participant
  to prepare for the upcoming response. A review of chronometric and psychophysiological
  studies reveals the prevailing view that this temporal preparation operates mainly
  at a motor level speeding up rather late processes. To assess the locus of this
  preparation effect, we conducted two experiments employing the lateralized readiness
  potential (LRP). Contrary to this prevailing view, the results of both experiments
  clearly indicate that temporal preparation enhances the processing speed of relatively
  early processes, because a manipulation of temporal uncertainty affected RT, the
  P300 latency, and the stimulus-to-LRP interval but not the LRP-to-keypress interval.
