abstract: 'OBJECTIVE  The aim of this study was to assess motivation as a factor in
  mental fatigue using subjective, performance, and physiological measures.  BACKGROUND  Sustained
  performance on a mentally demanding task can decrease over time. This decrement
  has two possible causes: a decline in available resources, meaning that performance
  cannot be sustained, and decrement in motivation, meaning a decline in willingness
  to sustain performance. However, so far, few experimental paradigms have effectively
  and continuously manipulated motivation, which is essential to understand its effect
  on mental fatigue.  METHOD  Twenty participants performed a working memory task
  with 14 blocks, which alternated between reward and nonreward for 2.5 hr. In the
  reward blocks, monetary rewards could be gained for good performance. Besides reaction
  time and accuracy, we used physiological measures (heart rate variability, pupil
  diameter, eyeblink, eye movements with a video distractor) and subjective measures
  of fatigue and mental effort.  RESULTS  Participants reported becoming fatigued
  over time and invested more mental effort in the reward blocks. Even though they
  reported fatigue, their accuracy in the reward blocks remained constant but declined
  in the nonreward blocks. Furthermore, in the nonreward blocks, participants became
  more distractable, invested less cognitive effort, blinked more often, and made
  fewer saccades. These results showed an effect of motivation on mental fatigue.  CONCLUSION  The
  evidence suggests that motivation is an important factor in explaining the effects
  of mental fatigue.'
