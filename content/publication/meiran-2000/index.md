abstract: Participants switched between two randomly ordered, two-choice reaction-time
  (RT) tasks, where an instructional cue preceded the target stimulus and indicated
  which task to execute. Task-switching cost dissipated passively while the participants
  waited for the instructional cue in order to know which task to execute (during
  the Response-Cue Interval). Switching cost was sharply reduced, but not abolished,
  when the participants actively prepared for the task switch in response to the instructional
  cue (during the Cue-Target Interval). The preparation for a task switch has shown
  not to be a by-product of general preparation by phasic alertness or predicting
  target onset. It is suggested that task-switching cost has at least three components
  reflecting (1) the passive dissipation of the previous task set, (2) the preparation
  of the new task set, and (3) a residual component.
