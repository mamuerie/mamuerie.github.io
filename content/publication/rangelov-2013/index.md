abstract: 'Performing two randomly alternating tasks typically results in higher reaction
  times (RTs) following a task switch, relative to a task repetition. These task switch
  costs (TSC) reflect processes of switching between control settings for different
  tasks. The present study investigated whether task sets operate as a single, integrated
  representation or as an agglomeration of relatively independent components. In a
  cued task switch paradigm, target detection (present/absent) and discrimination
  (blue/green/right-/left-tilted) tasks alternated randomly across trials. The target
  was either a color or an orientation singleton among homogeneous distractors. Across
  two trials, the task and target-defining dimension repeated or changed randomly.
  For task switch trials, agglomerated task sets predict a difference between dimension
  changes and repetitions: joint task and dimension switches require full task set
  reconfiguration, while dimension repetitions permit re-using some control settings
  from the previous trial. By contrast, integrated task sets always require full switches,
  predicting dimension repetition effects (DREs) to be absent across task switches.
  RT analyses showed significant DREs across task switches as well as repetitions
  supporting the notion of agglomerated task sets. Additionally, two event-related
  potentials (ERP) were analyzed: the Posterior-Contralateral-Negativity (PCN) indexing
  spatial selection dynamics, and the Sustained-Posterior-Contralateral-Negativity
  (SPCN) indexing post-selective perceptual/semantic analysis. Significant DREs across
  task switches were observed for both the PCN and SPCN components. Together, DREs
  across task switches for RTs and two functionally distinct ERP components suggest
  that re-using control settings across different tasks is possible. The results thus
  support the \"agglomerated-task-set\" hypothesis, and are inconsistent with \"integrated
  task sets.\"'
