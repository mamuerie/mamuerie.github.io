abstract: Here we test the hypothesis that fluctuations in subjective reports of mind
  wandering over time-on-task are associated with fluctuations in performance over
  time-on-task. In Study 1, we employed a singleton search task and found that performance
  did not differ prior to on- and off-task reports, nor did individual differences
  in mind wandering predict differences in performance (so-called standard analytic
  methods). Importantly however, we find that fluctuations in mind wandering over
  time are strongly associated with fluctuations in behavior. In Study 2, we provide
  a replication of the relation between mind wandering and performance over time found
  in Study 1, using a Flanker interference task. These data indicate (1) a tight coupling
  between mind wandering and performance over time and (2) that a temporal-analytic
  approach can reveal effects of mind wandering on performance in tasks where standard
  analyses fail to do so. The theoretical and methodological implications of these
  findings are discussed.
