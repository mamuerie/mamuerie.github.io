abstract: Current models of conflict processing propose that cognitive control resolves
  conflict in the flanker task by enhancing task-relevant stimulus processing at a
  perceptual level. However, because conflicts occur at both a perceptual and a response
  selection level in that task, we tested the hypothesis of conflict-specific control
  networks for perceptual and response selection conflicts using transcranial magnetic
  stimulation (TMS). TMS of the presupplementary motor area selectively disrupted
  the processing of response selection conflict, whereas TMS of the posterior intraparietal
  sulcus/inferior parietal lobule interfered with perceptual conflict processing.
  In more detail, the presupplementary motor area seems to resolve response selection
  conflict mainly when no conflicts have occurred in the previous trial. In contrast,
  the posterior intraparietal sulcus/inferior parietal lobule may resolve perceptual
  conflicts selectively when a conflict has occurred in the previous trial. The current
  data show the need for revising models of cognitive control by providing evidence
  for the existence of conflict-specific control networks resolving conflict at different
  processing levels.
