abstract: What do people feel like doing after they have exerted cognitive effort
  or are bored? Here, we empirically test whether people are drawn to rewards (at
  the neural level) following cognitive effort and boredom. This elucidates the experiences
  and consequences of engaging in cognitive effort, and compares it to the consequences
  of experiencing boredom, an affective state with predicted similar motivational
  consequences. Event-related potentials were recorded after participants (N,=,243)
  were randomized into one of three conditions - boredom (passively observing strings
  of numbers), cognitive effort (adding 3 to each digit of a four-digit number), or
  control. In the subsequent task, we focused on the feedback negativity (FN) to assess
  the brain's immediate response to the presence or absence of reward. Phenomenologically,
  participants in the boredom condition reported more fatigue than those in the cognitive
  effort condition, despite reporting exerting less effort. Results suggest participants
  in the boredom condition exhibited larger FN amplitude than participants in the
  control condition, while the cognitive effort condition was neither different from
  boredom nor control. The neural and methodological implications for ego depletion
  research, including issues of replicability, are discussed.
