abstract: "We present here \\\"Just Another Tool for Online Studies\\\" (JATOS): an
  open source, cross-platform web application with a graphical user interface (GUI)
  that greatly simplifies setting up and communicating with a web server to host online
  studies that are written in JavaScript. JATOS is easy to install in all three major
  platforms (Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux), and seamlessly pairs with a
  database for secure data storage. It can be installed on a server or locally, allowing
  researchers to try the application and feasibility of their studies within a browser
  environment, before engaging in setting up a server. All communication with the
  JATOS server takes place via a GUI (with no need to use a command line interface),
  making JATOS an especially accessible tool for researchers without a strong IT background.
  We describe JATOS' main features and implementation and provide a detailed tutorial
  along with example studies to help interested researchers to set up their online
  studies. JATOS can be found under the Internet address: www.jatos.org."
