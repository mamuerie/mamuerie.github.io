abstract: Working memory (WM) performance declines with age. However, several studies
  have shown that WM training may lead to performance increases not only in the trained
  task, but also in untrained cognitive transfer tasks. It has been suggested that
  transfer effects occur if training task and transfer task share specific processing
  components that are supposedly processed in the same brain areas. In the current
  study, we investigated whether single-task WM training and training-related alterations
  in neural activity might support performance in a dual-task setting, thus assessing
  transfer effects to higher-order control processes in the context of dual-task coordination.
  A sample of older adults (age 60-72) was assigned to either a training or control
  group. The training group participated in 12 sessions of an adaptive n-back training.
  At pre and post-measurement, a multimodal dual-task was performed in all participants
  to assess transfer effects. This task consisted of two simultaneous delayed match
  to sample WM tasks using two different stimulus modalities (visual and auditory)
  that were performed either in isolation (single-task) or in conjunction (dual-task).
  A subgroup also participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during
  the performance of the n-back task before and after training. While no transfer
  to single-task performance was found, dual-task costs in both the visual modality
  (p $<$ 0.05) and the auditory modality (p $<$ 0.05) decreased at post-measurement
  in the training but not in the control group. In the fMRI subgroup of the training
  participants, neural activity changes in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
  during one-back predicted post-training auditory dual-task costs, while neural activity
  changes in right DLPFC during three-back predicted visual dual-task costs. Results
  might indicate an improvement in central executive processing that could facilitate
  both WM and dual-task coordination.
