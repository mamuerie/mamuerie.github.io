abstract: Human functional MRI (fMRI) research primarily focuses on analyzing data
  averaged across groups, which limits the detail, specificity, and clinical utility~of
  fMRI resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and task-activation maps. To push
  our understanding of functional brain organization to the level of~individual humans,
  we assembled a novel MRI dataset containing 5~hr of RSFC data, 6~hr of~task fMRI,
  multiple structural MRIs, and neuropsychological tests from each of ten adults.
  Using~these data, we generated ten high-fidelity, individual-specific~functional
  connectomes. This individual-connectome approach revealed several new types~of spatial
  and organizational variability in brain networks, including unique network features
  and topologies that corresponded with structural and task-derived brain features.
  We are~releasing this highly sampled, individual-focused dataset as~a resource for
  neuroscientists, and we propose precision individual connectomics as a model for
  future work examining the organization of healthy and diseased individual human
  brains.
