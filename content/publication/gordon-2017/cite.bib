 abstract = {Human functional MRI (fMRI) research primarily focuses on analyzing data averaged across groups, which limits the detail, specificity, and clinical utility~of fMRI resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and task-activation maps. To push our understanding of functional brain organization to the level of~individual humans, we assembled a novel MRI dataset containing 5~hr of RSFC data, 6~hr of~task fMRI, multiple structural MRIs, and neuropsychological tests from each of ten adults. Using~these data, we generated ten high-fidelity, individual-specific~functional connectomes. This individual-connectome approach revealed several new types~of spatial and organizational variability in brain networks, including unique network features and topologies that corresponded with structural and task-derived brain features. We are~releasing this highly sampled, individual-focused dataset as~a resource for neuroscientists, and we propose precision individual connectomics as a model for future work examining the organization of healthy and diseased individual human brains.},
