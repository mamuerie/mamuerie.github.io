abstract: The family of neuroimaging analytical techniques known as multivoxel pattern
  analysis (MVPA) has dramatically increased in popularity over the past decade, particularly
  in social and affective neuroscience research using functional magnetic resonance
  imaging (fMRI). MVPA examines patterns of neural responses, rather than analyzing
  single voxel or region-based values, as is customary in conventional univariate
  analyses. Here, we provide a practical introduction to MVPA and its most popular
  variants (namely, representational similarity analysis and decoding analyses, such
  as classification using machine learning) for social and affective neuroscientists
  of all levels, particularly those new to such methods. We discuss how MVPA differs
  from traditional mass-univariate analyses, the benefits MVPA offers social neuroscientists,
  experimental design and analysis considerations, step-by-step instructions for how
  to implement specific analyses in one's own dataset, and issues that are currently
  facing research using MVPA methods.
