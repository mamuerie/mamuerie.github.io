abstract: Lateralized readiness potential (LRP) and time-frequency domain LRP-type
  measures, called motor-related amplitude asymmetries (MRAA), in the mu band (9-13
  Hz; mu-MRAA) and the beta band (18-26 Hz; beta-MRAA) were used to study the time
  course of preparation in a task-switching task and a response precuing task. Several
  dissociations between LRP and mu-MRAA and beta-MRAA were found. Mu-MRAA and beta-MRAA,
  but not LRP, exhibited an early and strong reversal in cortical lateralization when
  advance preparation for a switch of response hand was required. LRP, but not mu-MRAA
  or beta-MRAA, was sensitive to manipulation of the probability that advance preparation
  of response hand would be useful in a response precuing task. These dissociations
  replicate earlier findings and suggest that movement-related cortical rhythms and
  cortical potentials are associated with distinct preparatory component processes
  that differ in terms of level of abstraction and effort, in line with similar functional
  distinctions between component processes underlying executive control in task switching.
  This suggests that a fine-grained analysis of subprocesses involved in motor control
  may provide important guiding principles for the study and understanding of levels
  and mechanisms of cognitive control.
