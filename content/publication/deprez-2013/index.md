abstract: Insight into the neural architecture of multitasking is crucial when investigating
  the pathophysiology of multitasking deficits in clinical populations. Presently,
  little is known about how the brain combines dual-tasking with a concurrent short-term
  memory task, despite the relevance of this mental operation in daily life and the
  frequency of complaints related to this process, in disease. In this study we aimed
  to examine how the brain responds when a memory task is added to dual-tasking. Thirty-three
  right-handed healthy volunteers (20 females, mean age 39.9 Â± 5.8) were examined
  with functional brain imaging (fMRI). The paradigm consisted of two cross-modal
  single tasks (a visual and auditory temporal same-different task with short delay),
  a dual-task combining both single tasks simultaneously and a multi-task condition,
  combining the dual-task with an additional short-term memory task (temporal same-different
  visual task with long delay). Dual-tasking compared to both individual visual and
  auditory single tasks activated a predominantly right-sided fronto-parietal network
  and the cerebellum. When adding the additional short-term memory task, a larger
  and more bilateral frontoparietal network was recruited. We found enhanced activity
  during multitasking in components of the network that were already involved in dual-tasking,
  suggesting increased working memory demands, as well as recruitment of multitask-specific
  components including areas that are likely to be involved in online holding of visual
  stimuli in short-term memory such as occipito-temporal cortex. These results confirm
  concurrent neural processing of a visual short-term memory task during dual-tasking
  and provide evidence for an effective fMRI multitasking paradigm.
