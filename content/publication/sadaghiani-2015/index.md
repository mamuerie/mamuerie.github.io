abstract: Most brain activity occurs in an ongoing manner not directly locked to external
  events or stimuli. Regional ongoing activity fluctuates in unison with some brain
  regions but not others, and the degree of long-range coupling is called functional
  connectivity, often measured with correlation. Strength and spatial distributions
  of functional connectivity dynamically change in an ongoing manner over seconds
  to minutes, even when the external environment is held constant. Direct evidence
  for any behavioral relevance of these continuous large-scale dynamics has been limited.
  Here, we investigated whether ongoing changes in baseline functional connectivity
  correlate with perception. In a continuous auditory detection task, participants
  perceived the target sound in roughly one-half of the trials. Very long (22-40 s)
  interstimulus intervals permitted investigation of baseline connectivity unaffected
  by preceding evoked responses. Using multivariate classification, we observed that
  functional connectivity before the target predicted whether it was heard or missed.
  Using graph theoretical measures, we characterized the difference in functional
  connectivity between states that lead to hits vs. misses. Before misses compared
  with hits and task-free rest, connectivity showed reduced modularity, a measure
  of integrity of modular network structure. This effect was strongest in the default
  mode and visual networks and caused by both reduced within-network connectivity
  and enhanced across-network connections before misses. The relation of behavior
  to prestimulus connectivity was dissociable from that of prestimulus activity amplitudes.
  In conclusion, moment to moment dynamic changes in baseline functional connectivity
  may shape subsequent behavioral performance. A highly modular network structure
  seems beneficial to perceptual efficiency.
