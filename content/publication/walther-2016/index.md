abstract: 'Representational similarity analysis of activation patterns has become
  an increasingly important tool for studying brain representations. The dissimilarity
  between two patterns is commonly quantified by the correlation distance or the accuracy
  of a linear classifier. However, there are many different ways to measure pattern
  dissimilarity and little is known about their relative reliability. Here, we compare
  the reliability of three classes of dissimilarity measure: classification accuracy,
  Euclidean/Mahalanobis distance, and Pearson correlation distance. Using simulations
  and four real functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets, we demonstrate
  that continuous dissimilarity measures are substantially more reliable than the
  classification accuracy. The difference in reliability can be explained by two characteristics
  of classifiers: discretization and susceptibility of the discriminant function to
  shifts of the pattern ensemble between imaging runs. Reliability can be further
  improved through multivariate noise normalization for all measures. Finally, unlike
  conventional distance measures, crossvalidated distances provide unbiased estimates
  of pattern dissimilarity on a ratio scale, thus providing an interpretable zero
  point. Overall, our results indicate that the crossvalidated Mahalanobis distance
  is preferable to both the classification accuracy and the correlation distance for
  characterizing representational geometries.'
