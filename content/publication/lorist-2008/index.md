abstract: The influence of mental fatigue, as induced by time on task, on top-down
  control involved in planning goal-directed behavior and conflict resolution was
  examined, using an S1-S2 paradigm. S2 stimuli consisted of compatible and incompatible
  stimuli, placing dissimilar demands on automatic and controlled processes involved
  in conflict solving. Information provided by explicit cues (S1) affected brain activity
  elicited during the S1-S2 interval. P2 and CNV effects were more pronounced if advance
  information was relevant for subsequent behavior (hand cue) than after a cue providing
  information about stimulus features of S2 (color cue). Brain activity elicited by
  cue information was significantly attenuated with time on task. The behavioral results
  showed that advance information facilitated processing of S2; reactions were faster
  if cue information was valid, especially in the hand cue condition. In this condition
  invalid information led to significant costs in the form of increased error rates,
  as well. Performance efficiency deteriorated with time on task and differences between
  validly and invalidly cued stimuli became smaller. Concerning the time course of
  the behavioral effect it seems that top-down processes indexed by the CNV are the
  most likely candidate to underlie the performance effects of mental fatigue. Time
  on task effects on the cue-P2 were unrelated to observed behavioral effects. These
  results showed that the influence of advance information on information processing
  diminished with increasing mental fatigue. No evidence was found that mental fatigue
  had differential effects on controlled and automatic processes involved in conflict
  solving.
