abstract: The present study investigates the effect of practice in a psychological
  refractory period (PRP) paradigm on the backward compatibility effect (BCE), in
  order to determine the locus of this response priming effect on Task1 performance.
  In two experiments, we show that the size of the BCE is closely associated with
  the duration of the response selection stage in Task1. When this stage is shortened
  through PRP practice, the magnitude of the BCE decreases. Subsequently increasing
  the duration of Task1 response selection results in a larger BCE, but manipulating
  the same stage in Task2 does not. Our results suggest that the BCE reflects crosstalk
  of unattended response information for Task2 acting on the response selection stage
  in Task1, and that response information for two tasks may be activated simultaneously.
