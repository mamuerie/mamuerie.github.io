abstract: The backward crosstalk effect (BCE) in dual tasking means that characteristics
  of Task 2 of 2 subsequently performed tasks influence Task 1 performance. This observation
  indicates that certain features of the second response are already activated to
  some degree before the first response is selected. Therefore, the BCE challenges
  bottleneck models, which assume that Task 2 response selection does not begin until
  Task 1 response selection is finished. Instead, an extended model with a capacity-unlimited
  response activation stage prior to the bottleneck as the locus of the BCE was suggested.
  To determine the exact locus of the BCE within the stages of task processing, 5
  experiments were carried out. Experiments 1 to 4 were psychological refractory period-like
  experiments with 3 subsequent tasks. A prebottleneck locus of the BCE was ruled
  out in Experiments 1 to 3 by using the locus of slack logic. Additionally, a postbottleneck
  locus of the BCE was ruled out in Experiment 4 by using the effect propagation logic.
  To further support this latter conclusion, Experiment 5 applied a go-signal manipulation.
  Taken together, the results of all 5 experiments strongly suggest that the BCE has
  its locus in the capacity-limited stage, which contradicts the widely accepted notion
  that a capacity-unlimited stage of response activation preceding response selection
  proper is the locus of the BCE. (PsycINFO Database Record
