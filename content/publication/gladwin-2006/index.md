abstract: 'The task-switching paradigm provides an opportunity to study whether oscillatory
  relations in neuronal activity are involved in switching between and maintaining
  task sets. The EEG of subjects performing an alternating runs [Rogers, R.D., Monsell,
  S., 1995. Costs of a predictable switch between simple cognitive tasks. Journal
  of Experimental Psychology: General 124, 207-231] task-switching task was analyzed
  using event-related potentials, the lateralized readiness potential, instantaneous
  amplitude and the phase-locking value [Lachaux, J.P., Rodriguez, E., Martinirie,
  J., Varela, F.J., 1999. Measuring phase synchrony in brain signals. Human Brain
  Mapping 8, 194-208]. The two tasks differed in the relevant modality (visual versus
  auditory) and the hand with which responses were to be given. The mixture model
  [de Jong, R., 2000. An intention driven account of residual switch costs. In: Monsell,
  S., Driver, J. (Eds.), Attention and Performance XVII: Cognitive Control. MIT Press,
  Cambridge] was used to assign pre-stimulus switch probabilities to switch trials
  based on reaction time; these probabilities were used to create a fast-slow distinction
  between trials on both switch and hold trials. Results showed both time- and time-frequency-domain
  effects, during the intervals preceding stimuli, of switching versus maintenance,
  response speed of the upcoming stimulus, and response hand. Of potential importance
  for task-switching theory were interactions between reaction time by switch-hold
  trial type that were found for a frontal slow negative potential and the lateralized
  readiness potential during the response-stimulus interval, indicating that effective
  preparation for switch trials involves different anticipatory activity than for
  hold trials. Theta-band oscillatory activity during the pre-stimulus period was
  found to be higher when subsequent reaction times were shorter, but this response
  speed effect did not interact with trial type. The response hand of the upcoming
  task was associated with lateralization of pre-stimulus mu- and beta-band amplitude
  and, specifically for switch trials, beta-band phase locking.'
