abstract: 'Advanced brain imaging analysis methods, including multivariate pattern
  analysis (MVPA), functional connectivity, and functional alignment, have become
  powerful tools in cognitive neuroscience over the past decade. These tools are implemented
  in custom code and separate packages, often requiring different software and language
  proficiencies. Although usable by expert researchers, novice users face a steep
  learning curve. These difficulties stem from the use of new programming languages
  (e.g., Python), learning how to apply machine-learning methods to high-dimensional
  fMRI data, and minimal documentation and training materials. Furthermore, most standard
  fMRI analysis packages (e.g., AFNI, FSL, SPM) focus on preprocessing and univariate
  analyses, leaving a gap in how to integrate with advanced tools. To address these
  needs, we developed BrainIAK (brainiak.org), an open-source Python software package
  that seamlessly integrates several cutting-edge, computationally efficient techniques
  with other Python packages (e.g., Nilearn, Scikit-learn) for file handling, visualization,
  and machine learning. To disseminate these powerful tools, we developed user-friendly
  tutorials (in Jupyter format; https://brainiak.org/tutorials/) for learning BrainIAK
  and advanced fMRI analysis in Python more generally. These materials cover techniques
  including: MVPA (pattern classification and representational similarity analysis);
  parallelized searchlight analysis; background connectivity; full correlation matrix
  analysis; inter-subject correlation; inter-subject functional connectivity; shared
  response modeling; event segmentation using hidden Markov models; and real-time
  fMRI. For long-running jobs or large memory needs we provide detailed guidance on
  high-performance computing clusters. These notebooks were successfully tested at
  multiple sites, including as problem sets for courses at Yale and Princeton universities
  and at various workshops and hackathons. These materials are freely shared, with
  the hope that they become part of a pool of open-source software and educational
  materials for large-scale, reproducible fMRI analysis and accelerated discovery.'
