abstract: 'The goal of the presented experiments was to investigate the dynamic interplay
  of task shielding and its relaxation during task switching. Task shielding refers
  to the finding that single task sets in terms of 2-choice categorization rules help
  shielding against distraction from irrelevant stimulus attributes. During task switching,
  this shielding should temporarily be relaxed to prevent the perseveration of the
  previous task, on the downside making the system more vulnerable toward the intrusion
  of irrelevant information. Participants had to switch between a digit and a letter
  categorization task. An irrelevant stimulus feature (Experiment 1: color, Experiment
  2: font) varied randomly, orthogonal to the task. The presence or absence of an
  interaction of the irrelevant feature (switch vs. repetition) and the response (switch
  vs. repetition) was taken as evidence for the absence or presence of task shielding,
  respectively. Replicating previous results, irrelevant feature and response did
  not interact on task repetitions, indicating successful shielding. On task switches,
  however, the irrelevant feature interacted with the response, supporting the assumption
  that task shielding is temporarily relaxed during task switching.'
