abstract: 'Traditional approaches to action control assume the existence of a more
  or less unitary control system that struggles with, and serves to overcome action
  tendencies induced by automatic processes. In this article, I point out that and
  why these approaches fail to capture the complexity and dynamics of cognitive control.
  I describe an alternative approach that assumes that control emerges from the interaction
  of at least two counteracting forces: one system promoting persistence and the maintenance
  of action goals and another promoting mental and behavioral flexibility. I describe
  how this interaction might be shaped by various factors, including genetic predisposition,
  learning, personal experience, and the cultural context, and suggest a simple functional
  model (the Metacontrol State Model, MSM) that explains how this shaping process
  works. Then I provide an overview of studies from various fields (including perception,
  attention, performance monitoring, conflict resolution, creativity, meditation,
  religion, and interpersonal perception and behavior) that successfully tested predictions
  from the MSM.'
