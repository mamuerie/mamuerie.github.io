abstract: How do scientists decide where to submit manuscripts? Many factors influence
  this decision, including prestige, acceptance probability, turnaround time, target
  audience, fit, and impact factor. Here, we present a framework for evaluating where
  to submit a manuscript based on the theory of Markov decision processes. We derive
  two models, one in which an author is trying to optimally maximize citations and
  another in which that goal is balanced by either minimizing the number of resubmissions
  or the total time in review. We parameterize the models with data on acceptance
  probability, submission-to-decision times, and impact factors for 61 ecology journals.
  We find that submission sequences beginning with Ecology Letters, Ecological Monographs,
  or PLOS ONE could be optimal depending on the importance given to time to acceptance
  or number of resubmissions. This analysis provides some guidance on where to submit
  a manuscript given the individual-specific values assigned to these disparate objectives.
