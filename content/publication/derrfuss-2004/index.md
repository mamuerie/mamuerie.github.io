abstract: Cognitive control has often been associated with activations of middorsolateral
  prefrontal cortex. However, recent evidence highlights the importance of a more
  posterior frontolateral region around the junction of the inferior frontal sulcus
  and the inferior precentral sulcus (the inferior frontal junction area, IFJ). In
  the present experiment, we investigated the involvement of the IFJ in a task-switching
  paradigm, a manual Stroop task, and a verbal n-back task in a within-session within-group
  design. After computing contrasts for the individual tasks, the resulting z maps
  were overlaid to identify areas commonly activated by these tasks. Common activations
  were found in the IFJ, in the pre-SMA extending into mesial BA 8, in the middle
  frontal gyrus bordering the inferior frontal sulcus, in the anterior insula, and
  in parietal and thalamic regions. These results indicate the existence of a network
  of prefrontal, parietal, and subcortical regions mediating cognitive control in
  task coordination, interference control, and working memory. In particular, the
  results provide evidence for the assumption that, in the frontolateral cortex, not
  only the middorsolateral region but also the IFJ plays an important role in cognitive
  control.
