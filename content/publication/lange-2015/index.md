abstract: Time-consuming processes of task-set reconfiguration have been shown to
  contribute to the costs of switching between cognitive tasks. We describe and probe
  a novel mechanism serving to reduce the costs of task-set reconfiguration. We propose
  that when individuals are uncertain about the currently valid task, one task set
  is activated for execution while other task sets are maintained at a pre-active
  state in cognitive cache. We tested this idea by assessing an event-related potential
  (ERP) index of task-set reconfiguration in a three-rule task-switching paradigm
  involving varying degrees of task uncertainty. In high-uncertainty conditions, two
  viable tasks were equally likely to be correct whereas in low-uncertainty conditions,
  one task was more likely than the other. ERP and performance measures indicated
  substantial costs of task-set reconfiguration when participants were required to
  switch away from a task that had been likely to be correct. In contrast, task-set-reconfiguration
  costs were markedly reduced when the previous task set was chosen under high task
  uncertainty. These results suggest that cognitive caching of alternative task sets
  adds to human cognitive flexibility under high task uncertainty.
