abstract: Many cognitive abilities decline with age even in the absence of detectable
  pathology. Recent evidence indicates that age-related neural dedifferentiation,
  operationalized in terms of neural selectivity, may contribute to this decline.
  We review here work exploring the relationship between neural dedifferentiation,
  cognition, and age. Compelling evidence for age effects on neural selectivity comes
  from both non-human animal and human research. However, current data suggest that
  age does not moderate the observed relationships between neural dedifferentiation
  and cognitive performance. We propose that functionally significant variance in
  measures of neural dedifferentiation reflects both age-dependent and age-independent
  factors. We further propose that the effects of age on neural dedifferentiation
  do not exclusively reflect detrimental consequences of aging.
