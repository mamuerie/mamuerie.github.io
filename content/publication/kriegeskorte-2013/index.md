abstract: The cognitive concept of representation plays a key role in theories of
  brain information processing. However, linking neuronal activity to representational
  content and cognitive theory remains challenging. Recent studies have characterized
  the representational geometry of neural population codes by means of representational
  distance matrices, enabling researchers to compare representations across stages
  of processing and to test cognitive and computational theories. Representational
  geometry provides a useful intermediate level of description, capturing both the
  information represented in a neuronal population code and the format in which it
  is represented. We review recent insights gained with this approach in perception,
  memory, cognition, and action. Analyses of representational geometry can compare
  representations between models and the brain, and promise to explain brain computation
  as transformation of representational similarity structure.
