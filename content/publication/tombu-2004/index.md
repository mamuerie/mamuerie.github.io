abstract: An examination of previous claims for virtually perfect time-sharing in
  dual-task situations reveals confounding effects that may have obscured dual-task
  interference. Two experiments are conducted in which these confounding effects are
  minimized, revealing statistically significant dual-task interference. These results
  support the hypothesis that human information processing is dominated by a structural
  central capacity limitation and call into question the hypothesis that dual-task
  interference can be eliminated by meeting the 5 conditions outlined by D. Meyer
  and D. Kieras (1999).
