abstract: 'With large inter-individual variability, older adults show a decline in
  cognitive performance in dual-task situations. Differences in attentional processes,
  working memory, response selection, and general speed of information processing
  have been discussed as potential sources of this decline and its between-subject
  variability. In comparison to young subjects (n,=,36, mean age: 25 years), we analyzed
  the performance of a large group of healthy elderly subjects (n,=,138, mean age:
  70 years) in a conflicting dual-task situation (PRP paradigm). Based on their dual-task
  costs (DTCs), the older participants were clustered in three groups of high, medium,
  and low performing elderly. DTCs differed between groups and increased linearly
  from young subjects to low performing elderly. The groups did not differ with respect
  to ERP-components related to task preparation (CNV) and recall of stimulus-response
  mappings (P2). Peak latencies of the frontocentral P2 and N2 were shorter in young
  as compared to older adults but did not differ between elderly performance groups.
  However, differences in N2 amplitude between short and long SOA were correlated
  with the corresponding DTCs, suggesting more efficient S-R implementation in subjects
  with lower DTCs. Based on our results, between-subject differences in dual-task
  interference can be explained in terms of individual differences in selection of
  an appropriate response in dual-task situations.'
