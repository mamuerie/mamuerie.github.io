abstract: In cognitive research, speed and accuracy are two important aspects of performance.
  When analyzed separately, these performance variables sometimes lead to contradictory
  conclusions about the effect of a manipulation. To avoid such conflicts, several
  measures that integrate speed and accuracy have been proposed, but the added value
  of using such measures remains unclear. The present paper compares the relative
  utility of seven integrated performance measures, namely four variations on a binning
  procedure that weights response times of correct and incorrect trials differently,
  and three measures that combine averaged speed and accuracy scores. The properties
  of these integrated measures were explored in three simulation studies. The first
  study compared three binning measures and showed that one measure failed to grasp
  the performance difference between two conditions. The second study showed that
  the sampling distributions of the measures were symmetric, except for a strong skewness
  on the rate correct score. The third study varied the trade-off and the effect sizes
  of speed and accuracy in four different combinations of size and direction of speed
  and accuracy effects. These studies highlighted some further shortcomings of the
  binning measures. The combination measures performed well, but linear integration
  of speed and accuracy and rate correct score were most efficient in detecting effects
  and accounting for a larger proportion of the variance. The paper concludes that
  these combination measures are useful provided that the speed and accuracy data
  are also inspected.
