abstract: In everyday life, mental fatigue can be detrimental across many domains
  including driving, learning, and working. Given the importance of understanding
  and accounting for the deleterious effects of mental fatigue on behavior, a growing
  body of literature has studied the role of motivational and executive control processes
  in mental fatigue. In typical laboratory paradigms, participants complete a task
  that places demand on these self-control processes and are later given a subsequent
  task. Generally speaking, decrements to subsequent task performance are taken as
  evidence that the initial task created mental fatigue through the continued engagement
  of motivational and executive functions. Several models have been developed to account
  for negative transfer resulting from this \"ego depletion.\" In the current study,
  we provide a brief literature review, specify current theoretical approaches to
  ego-depletion, and report an empirical test of current models of depletion. Across
  4 experiments we found minimal evidence for executive control depletion along with
  strong evidence for motivation mediated ego depletion. (PsycINFO Database Record
