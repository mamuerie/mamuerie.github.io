abstract: There is an ongoing debate in the scientific community regarding whether
  a state of mental fatigue may have a negative effect upon a range of objective and
  subjective measures of human performance. This issue has attracted attention from
  several fields, including sport and exercise sciences. In fact, a considerable body
  of literature in the sport science field has suggested that performing a long and
  demanding cognitive task might lead to a state of mental fatigue, impairing subsequent
  exercise performance, although research in this field has shown contradictory results.
  Here, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate these inconsistent findings. The
  analysis yielded small-to-medium effects of mental fatigue on exercise performance,
  dz = 0.50, and RPE, dz = 0.21. However, a three-parameter selection model also revealed
  evidence of publication or reporting biases, suggesting that the bias-corrected
  estimates might be substantially lower (0.08 and 0.10, respectively) and non-significant.
  In sum, current evidence does not provide conclusive support for the claim that
  mental fatigue has a negative influence on exercise performance.
