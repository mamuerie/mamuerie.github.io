abstract: The present study examined the role of crosstalk in dual-task interference
  using a combination of a nonspeeded visual task and an auditory-manual reaction
  time (RT) task. The potential for dual-task crosstalk was introduced by presenting
  in the visual task objects (e.g., a cup with a handle), which \"afford\" associated
  responses that were either spatially compatible or incompatible with the response
  in the RT task. Crucially, the degree of crosstalk was varied by instructing participants
  either to attend to the left-right orientation of the objects, creating explicit
  cross-task response-code overlap (\"strong crosstalk\"), or to attend to object
  identity (no direct overlap; \"weak crosstalk\"). The data indicated a relative
  benefit for cross-task compatible trials, which was much greater with strong crosstalk
  than with weak crosstalk. Crucially, however, even on compatible trials dual-task
  performance was substantially worse with strong crosstalk than with weak crosstalk.
  This overall cost of crosstalk suggests interference of response codes even on compatible
  dual-task trials.
