abstract: Head motion systematically alters correlations in resting state functional
  connectivity fMRI (RSFC). In this report we examine impact of motion on signal intensity
  and RSFC correlations. We find that motion-induced signal changes (1) are often
  complex and variable waveforms, (2) are often shared across nearly all brain voxels,
  and (3) often persist more than 10s after motion ceases. These signal changes, both
  during and after motion, increase observed RSFC correlations in a distance-dependent
  manner. Motion-related signal changes are not removed by a variety of motion-based
  regressors, but are effectively reduced by global signal regression. We link several
  measures of data quality to motion, changes in signal intensity, and changes in
  RSFC correlations. We demonstrate that improvements in data quality measures during
  processing may represent cosmetic improvements rather than true correction of the
  data. We demonstrate a within-subject, censoring-based artifact removal strategy
  based on volume censoring that reduces group differences due to motion to chance
  levels. We note conditions under which group-level regressions do and do not correct
  motion-related effects.
