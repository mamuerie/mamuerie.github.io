abstract: 'Working memory function declines across the lifespan. Computational models
  of aging attribute such memory impairments to reduced distinctiveness between neural
  representations of different mental states in old age, a phenomenon termed dedifferentiation.
  These models predict that neural distinctiveness should be reduced uniformly across
  experimental conditions in older adults. In contrast, the Compensation-Related Utilization
  of Neural Circuits Hypothesis (CRUNCH) model predicts that the distinctiveness of
  neural representations should be increased in older adults (relative to young adults)
  at low levels of task demand but reduced at high levels of demand. The present study
  used multi-voxel pattern analysis to measure the effects of age and task demands
  on the distinctiveness of the neural representations of verbal and visuospatial
  working memory. Neural distinctiveness was estimated separately for memory encoding,
  maintenance, and retrieval, and for low, medium, and high memory loads. Results
  from sensory cortex during encoding and retrieval were consistent with the dedifferentiation
  hypothesis: distinctiveness of visual cortical representations during these phases
  was uniformly reduced in older adults, irrespective of memory load. However, maintenance-related
  responses in prefrontal and parietal regions yielded a strikingly different pattern
  of results. At low loads, older adults showed higher distinctiveness than younger
  adults; at high loads, this pattern reversed, such that distinctiveness was higher
  in young adults. This interaction between age group and memory load is at odds with
  the dedifferentiation hypothesis but consistent with CRUNCH. In sum, our results
  provide partial support for both dedifferentiation- and compensation-based models;
  we argue that comprehensive theories of cognitive aging must incorporate aspects
  of both models to fully explain complex patterns of age-related neuro-cognitive
  change.'
