abstract: The current meta-analysis accumulates empirical findings on the phenomenon
  of mind-wandering, integrating and interpreting findings in light of psychological
  theories of cognitive resource allocation. Cognitive resource theory emphasizes
  both individual differences in attentional resources and task demands together to
  predict variance in task performance. This theory motivated our conceptual and meta-analysis
  framework by introducing moderators indicative of task-demand to predict who is
  more likely to mind-wander under what conditions, and to predict when mind-wandering
  and task-related thought are more (or less) predictive of task performance. Predictions
  were tested via a random-effects meta-analysis of correlations obtained from normal
  adult samples (k = 88) based on measurement of specified episodes of off-task and/or
  on-task thought frequency and task performance. Results demonstrated that people
  with fewer cognitive resources tend to engage in more mind-wandering, whereas those
  with more cognitive resources are more likely to engage in task-related thought.
  Addressing predictions of resource theory, we found that greater time-on-task-although
  not greater task complexity-tended to strengthen the negative relation between cognitive
  resources and mind-wandering. Additionally, increases in mind-wandering were generally
  associated with decreases in task performance, whereas increases in task-related
  thought were associated with increased performance. Further supporting resource
  theory, the negative relation between mind-wandering and performance was more pronounced
  for more complex tasks, though not longer tasks. Complementarily, the positive association
  between task-related thought and performance was stronger for more complex tasks
  and for longer tasks. We conclude by discussing implications and future research
  directions for mind-wandering as a construct of interest in psychological research.
