abstract: Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) has helped reveal the intrinsic
  network organization of the human brain, yet its relevance to cognitive task activations
  has been unclear. Uncertainty remains despite evidence that resting-state FC patterns
  are highly similar to cognitive task activation patterns. Identifying the distributed
  processes that shape localized cognitive task activations may help reveal why resting-state
  FC is so strongly related to cognitive task activations. We found that estimating
  task-evoked activity flow (the spread of activation amplitudes) over resting-state
  FC networks allowed prediction of cognitive task activations in a large-scale neural
  network model. Applying this insight to empirical functional MRI data, we found
  that cognitive task activations can be predicted in held-out brain regions (and
  held-out individuals) via estimated activity flow over resting-state FC networks.
  This suggests that task-evoked activity flow over intrinsic networks is a large-scale
  mechanism explaining the relevance of resting-state FC to cognitive task activations.
