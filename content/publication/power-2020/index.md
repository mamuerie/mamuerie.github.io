abstract: 'This article advances two parallel lines of argument about resting-state
  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals, one empirical and one conceptual.
  The empirical line creates a four-part organization of the text: (1) head motion
  and respiration commonly cause distinct, major, unwanted influences (artifacts)
  in fMRI signals; (2) head motion and respiratory changes are, confoundingly, both
  related to psychological and clinical and biological variables of interest; (3)
  many fMRI denoising strategies fail to identify and remove one or the other kind
  of artifact; and (4) unremoved artifact, due to correlations of artifacts with variables
  of interest, renders studies susceptible to identifying variance of noninterest
  as variance of interest. Arising from these empirical observations is a conceptual
  argument: that an event-related approach to task-free scans, targeting common behaviors
  during scanning, enables fundamental distinctions among the kinds of signals present
  in the data, information which is vital to understanding the effects of denoising
  procedures. This event-related perspective permits statements like \"Event X is
  associated with signals A, B, and C, each with particular spatial, temporal, and
  signal decay properties\". Denoising approaches can then be tailored, via performance
  in known events, to permit or suppress certain kinds of signals based on their desirability.'
