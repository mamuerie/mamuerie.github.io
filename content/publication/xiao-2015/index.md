abstract: Attention is important in error processing. Few studies have examined the
  link between sustained attention and error processing. In this study, we examined
  how error-related negativity (ERN) of a four-choice reaction time task was reduced
  in the mental fatigue condition and investigated the role of sustained attention
  in error processing. Forty-one recruited participants were divided into two groups.
  In the fatigue experiment group, 20 subjects performed a fatigue experiment and
  an additional continuous psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) for 1 h. In the normal
  experiment group, 21 subjects only performed the normal experimental procedures
  without the PVT test. Fatigue and sustained attention states were assessed with
  a questionnaire. Event-related potential results showed that ERN (p $<$ 0.005) and
  peak (p $<$ 0.05) mean amplitudes decreased in the fatigue experiment. ERN amplitudes
  were significantly associated with the attention and fatigue states in electrodes
  Fz, FC1, Cz, and FC2. These findings indicated that sustained attention was related
  to error processing and that decreased attention is likely the cause of error processing
  impairment.
