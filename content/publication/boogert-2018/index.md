abstract: Individuals vary in their cognitive performance. While this variation forms
  the foundation of the study of human psychometrics, its broader importance is only
  recently being recognized. Explicitly acknowledging this individual variation found
  in both humans and non-human animals provides a novel opportunity to understand
  the mechanisms, development and evolution of cognition. The papers in this special
  issue highlight the growing emphasis on individual cognitive differences from fields
  as diverse as neurobiology, experimental psychology and evolutionary biology. Here,
  we synthesize this body of work. We consider the distinct challenges in quantifying
  individual differences in cognition and provide concrete methodological recommendations.
  In particular, future studies would benefit from using multiple task variants to
  ensure they target specific, clearly defined cognitive traits and from conducting
  repeated testing to assess individual consistency. We then consider how neural,
  genetic, developmental and behavioural factors may generate individual differences
  in cognition. Finally, we discuss the potential fitness consequences of individual
  cognitive variation and place these into an evolutionary framework with testable
  hypotheses. We intend for this special issue to stimulate researchers to position
  individual variation at the centre of the cognitive sciences.This article is part
  of the theme issue 'Causes and consequences of individual differences in cognitive
  abilities'.
