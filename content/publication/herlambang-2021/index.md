abstract: 'There have been many studies attempting to disentangle the relation between
  motivation and mental fatigue. Mental fatigue occurs after performing a demanding
  task for a prolonged time, and many studies have suggested that motivation can counteract
  the negative effects of mental fatigue on task performance. To complicate matters,
  most mental fatigue studies looked exclusively at the effects of extrinsic motivation
  but not intrinsic motivation. Individuals are said to be extrinsically motivated
  when they perform a task to attain rewards and avoid punishments, while they are
  said to be intrinsically motivated when they do for the pleasure of doing the activity.
  To assess whether intrinsic motivation has similar effects as extrinsic motivation,
  we conducted an experiment using subjective, performance, and physiological measures
  (heart rate variability and pupillometry). In this experiment, 28 participants solved
  Sudoku puzzles on a computer for three hours, with a cat video playing in the corner
  of the screen. The experiment consisted of 14 blocks with two alternating conditions:
  low intrinsic motivation and high intrinsic motivation. The main results showed
  that irrespective of condition, participants reported becoming fatigued over time.
  They performed better, invested more mental effort physiologically, and were less
  distracted in high-level than in low-level motivation blocks. The results suggest
  that similarly to extrinsic motivation, time-on-task effects are modulated by the
  level of intrinsic motivation: With high intrinsic motivation, people can maintain
  their performance over time as they seem willing to invest more effort as time progresses
  than in low intrinsic motivation.'
