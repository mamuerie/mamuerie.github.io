abstract: 'The vigilance decrement has been described as a slowing in reaction times
  or an increase in error rates as an effect of time-on-task during tedious monitoring
  tasks. This decrement has been alternatively ascribed to either withdrawal of the
  supervisory attentional system, due to underarousal caused by the insufficient workload,
  or to a decreased attentional capacity and thus the impossibility to sustain mental
  effort. Furthermore, it has previously been reported that controlled processing
  is the locus of the vigilance decrement. This study aimed at answering three questions,
  to better define sustained attention. First, is endogenous attention more vulnerable
  to time-on-task than exogenous attention? Second, do measures of autonomic arousal
  provide evidence to support the underload vs overload hypothesis? And third, do
  these measures show a different effect for endogenous and exogenous attention? We
  applied a cued (valid vs invalid) conjunction search task, and ECG and respiration
  recordings were used to compute sympathetic (normalized low frequency power) and
  parasympathetic tone (respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA). Behavioural results showed
  a dual effect of time-on-task: the usually described vigilance decrement, expressed
  as increased reaction times (RTs) after 30 min for both conditions; and a higher
  cost in RTs after invalid cues for the endogenous condition only, appearing after
  60 min. Physiological results clearly support the underload hypothesis to subtend
  the vigilance decrement, since heart period and RSA increased over time-on-task.
  There was no physiological difference between the endogenous and exogenous conditions.
  Subjective experience of participants was more compatible with boredom than with
  high mental effort.'
