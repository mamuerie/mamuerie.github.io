abstract: The multivariate analysis of brain signals has recently sparked a great
  amount of interest, yet accessible and versatile tools to carry out decoding analyses
  are scarce. Here we introduce The Decoding Toolbox (TDT) which represents a user-friendly,
  powerful and flexible package for multivariate analysis of functional brain imaging
  data. TDT is written in Matlab and equipped with an interface to the widely used
  brain data analysis package SPM. The toolbox allows running fast whole-brain analyses,
  region-of-interest analyses and searchlight analyses, using machine learning classifiers,
  pattern correlation analysis, or representational similarity analysis. It offers
  automatic creation and visualization of diverse cross-validation schemes, feature
  scaling, nested parameter selection, a variety of feature selection methods, multiclass
  capabilities, and pattern reconstruction from classifier weights. While basic users
  can implement a generic analysis in one line of code, advanced users can extend
  the toolbox to their needs or exploit the structure to combine it with external
  high-performance classification toolboxes. The toolbox comes with an example data
  set which can be used to try out the various analysis methods. Taken together, TDT
  offers a promising option for researchers who want to employ multivariate analyses
  of brain activity patterns.
