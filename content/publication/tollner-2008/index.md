abstract: In cross-dimensional visual search tasks, target discrimination is faster
  when the previous trial contained a target defined in the same visual dimension
  as the current trial. The dimension-weighting account (DWA; A. Found & H. J. Müller,
  1996) explains this intertrial facilitation by assuming that visual dimensions are
  weighted at an early perceptual stage of processing. Recently, this view has been
  challenged by models claiming that intertrial facilitation effects are generated
  at later stages that follow attentional target selection (K. Mortier, J. Theeuwes,
  & P. A. Starreveld, 2005). To determine whether intertrial facilitation is generated
  at a perceptual stage, at the response selection stage, or both, the authors focused
  on specific event-related brain potential components (directly linkable to perceptual
  and response-related processing) during a compound search task. Visual dimension
  repetitions were mirrored by shorter latencies and enhanced amplitudes of the N2-posterior-
  contralateral, suggesting a facilitated allocation of attentional resources to the
  target. Response repetitions and changes systematically modulated the lateralized
  readiness potential amplitude, suggesting a benefit from residual activations of
  the previous trial biasing the correct response. Overall, the present findings strengthen
  the DWA by indicating a perceptual origin of dimension change costs in visual search.
