 abstract = {The ResponseOnsetTool (ROT; Reisner & Hinrichs, 2016) is a custom-made program created using MATLAB (The MathWorks; Natick, MA). The tool aims to facilitate automated extraction of reaction time latencies based on simple signal amplitude measurement. The present version (v1.0.0) represents the first prototype of the program. ROT is currently under development at https://github.com/davhin/ResponseOnsetTool. Further releases will be geared towards greater generalizability of the methods involved (e.g. dealing with different response phoneme) and more sophisticated techniques (e.g. fourier transform of signal to identify human voice by its spectrum).},
