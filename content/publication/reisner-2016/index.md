abstract: The ResponseOnsetTool (ROT; Reisner & Hinrichs, 2016) is a custom-made program
  created using MATLAB (The MathWorks; Natick, MA). The tool aims to facilitate automated
  extraction of reaction time latencies based on simple signal amplitude measurement.
  The present version (v1.0.0) represents the first prototype of the program. ROT
  is currently under development at https://github.com/davhin/ResponseOnsetTool. Further
  releases will be geared towards greater generalizability of the methods involved
  (e.g. dealing with different response phoneme) and more sophisticated techniques
  (e.g. fourier transform of signal to identify human voice by its spectrum).
