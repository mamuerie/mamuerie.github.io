abstract: It is generally agreed upon that the mechanisms underlying task switching
  heavily depend on working memory, yet numerous studies have failed to show a strong
  relationship between working memory capacity (WMC) and task-switching ability. We
  argue that this relationship does indeed exist but that the dependent variable used
  to measure task switching is problematic. To support our claim, we reanalyzed data
  from two studies with a new scoring procedure that combines reaction time (RT) and
  accuracy into a single score. The reanalysis revealed a strong relationship between
  task switching and WMC that was not present when RT-based switch costs were used
  as the dependent variable. We discuss the theoretical implications of this finding
  along with the potential uses and limitations of the scoring procedure we used.
  More broadly, we emphasize the importance of using measures that incorporate speed
  and accuracy in other areas of research, particularly in comparisons of subjects
  differing in cognitive and developmental levels.
