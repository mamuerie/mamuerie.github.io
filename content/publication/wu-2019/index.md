abstract: Individuals often need to make critical decisions even when they are in
  a fatigued state. Mental fatigue may lead to increased susceptibility to distraction
  and poor information processing but it is unclear exactly how fatigue shapes individuals'
  decision-making. We studied how mental fatigue influences sensitivity to contextual
  information, indexed as decoy bias. Mental fatigue was induced using a multi-source
  interference task, and decoy bias was assessed using a gambling task, in 124 young
  adults. Results showed that mental fatigue increased decoy bias through enhanced
  perceptual salience of contextual cues, but only in males. The findings provide
  insight into a gender-specific relationship between fatigue and poor judgments.
  This study extends the current literature on links between fatigue and poor decision-making
  by documenting a possible mechanism of the association. The results may have practical
  implications for designing optimal working hours and safeguarding people from suboptimal
  decisions.
