abstract: Introduction               Top-down control underlies our ability to attend
  relevant stimuli while ignoring irrelevant, distracting stimuli and is a critical
  process for prioritizing information in working memory (WM). Prior work has demonstrated
  that top-down biasing signals modulate sensory-selective cortical areas during WM,
  and that the large-scale organization of the brain reconfigures due to WM demands
  alone; however, it is not yet understood how brain networks reconfigure between
  the processing of relevant versus irrelevant information in the service of WM.                                         Methods               Here,
  we investigated the effects of task goals on brain network organization while participants
  performed a WM task that required participants to detect repetitions (e.g., 0-back
  or 1-back) and had varying levels of visual interference (e.g., distracting, irrelevant
  stimuli). We quantified changes in network modularity–a measure of brain sub-network
  segregation–that occurred depending on overall WM task difficulty as well as trial-level
  task goals for each stimulus during the task conditions (e.g., relevant or irrelevant).                                         Results               First,
  we replicated prior work and found that whole-brain modularity was lower during
  the more demanding WM task conditions compared to a baseline condition. Further,
  during the WM conditions with varying task goals, brain modularity was selectively
  lower during goal-directed processing of task-relevant stimuli to be remembered
  for WM performance compared to processing of distracting, irrelevant stimuli. Follow-up
  analyses indicated that this effect of task goals was most pronounced in default
  mode and visual sub-networks. Finally, we examined the behavioral relevance of these
  changes in modularity and found that individuals with lower modularity for relevant
  trials had faster WM task performance.                                         Discussion               These
  results suggest that brain networks can dynamically reconfigure to adopt a more
  integrated organization with greater communication between sub-networks that supports
  the goal-directed processing of relevant information and guides WM.
