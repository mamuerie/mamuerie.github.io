 abstract = {Introduction               Top-down control underlies our ability to attend relevant stimuli while ignoring irrelevant, distracting stimuli and is a critical process for prioritizing information in working memory (WM). Prior work has demonstrated that top-down biasing signals modulate sensory-selective cortical areas during WM, and that the large-scale organization of the brain reconfigures due to WM demands alone; however, it is not yet understood how brain networks reconfigure between the processing of relevant versus irrelevant information in the service of WM.                                         Methods               Here, we investigated the effects of task goals on brain network organization while participants performed a WM task that required participants to detect repetitions (e.g., 0-back or 1-back) and had varying levels of visual interference (e.g., distracting, irrelevant stimuli). We quantified changes in network modularity–a measure of brain sub-network segregation–that occurred depending on overall WM task difficulty as well as trial-level task goals for each stimulus during the task conditions (e.g., relevant or irrelevant).                                         Results               First, we replicated prior work and found that whole-brain modularity was lower during the more demanding WM task conditions compared to a baseline condition. Further, during the WM conditions with varying task goals, brain modularity was selectively lower during goal-directed processing of task-relevant stimuli to be remembered for WM performance compared to processing of distracting, irrelevant stimuli. Follow-up analyses indicated that this effect of task goals was most pronounced in default mode and visual sub-networks. Finally, we examined the behavioral relevance of these changes in modularity and found that individuals with lower modularity for relevant trials had faster WM task performance.                                         Discussion               These results suggest that brain networks can dynamically reconfigure to adopt a more integrated organization with greater communication between sub-networks that supports the goal-directed processing of relevant information and guides WM.},
