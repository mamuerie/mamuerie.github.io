abstract: We hypothesized that interactions between traits and context predict task
  engagement, as measured by the amplitude of the error-related negativity (ERN),
  performance, and relative frontal activity asymmetry (RFA). In Study 1, we found
  that drive for reward, absorption, and constraint independently predicted self-reported
  persistence. We hypothesized that, during a prolonged monotonous task, absorption
  would predict initial ERN amplitudes, constraint would delay declines in ERN amplitudes
  and deterioration of performance, and drive for reward would predict left RFA when
  a reward could be obtained. Study 2, employing EEG recordings, confirmed our predictions.
  The results showed that most traits that have in previous research been related
  to ERN amplitudes have a relationship with the motivational trait persistence in
  common. In addition, trait-context combinations that are likely associated with
  increased engagement predict larger ERN amplitudes and RFA. Together, these results
  support the hypothesis that engagement may be a common underlying factor predicting
  ERN amplitude.
