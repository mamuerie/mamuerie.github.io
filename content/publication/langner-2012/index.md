abstract: 'Sustained responsiveness to external stimulation is fundamental to many
  time-critical interactions with the outside world. We used functional magnetic resonance
  imaging during speeded stimulus detection to identify convergent and divergent neural
  correlates of maintaining the readiness to respond to auditory, tactile, and visual
  stimuli. In addition, using a multimodal condition, we investigated the effect of
  making stimulus modality unpredictable. Relative to sensorimotor control tasks,
  all three unimodal detection tasks elicited stronger activity in the right temporo-parietal
  junction, inferior frontal cortex, anterior insula, dorsal premotor cortex, and
  anterior cingulate cortex as well as bilateral mid-cingulum, midbrain, brainstem,
  and medial cerebellum. The multimodal detection condition additionally activated
  left dorsal premotor cortex and bilateral precuneus. Modality-specific modulations
  were confined to respective sensory areas: we found activity increases in relevant,
  and decreases in irrelevant sensory cortices. Our findings corroborate the modality
  independence of a predominantly right-lateralized core network for maintaining an
  alert (i.e., highly responsive) state and extend previous results to the somatosensory
  modality. Monitoring multiple sensory channels appears to induce additional processing,
  possibly related to stimulus-driven shifts of intermodal attention. The results
  further suggest that directing attention to a given sensory modality selectively
  enhances and suppresses sensory processing—even in simple detection tasks, which
  do not require inter- or intra-modal selection. Hum Brain Mapp 33:398–418, 2012.
