abstract: 'Theoretical models and preceding studies have described age-related alterations
  in neuronal activation of frontoparietal regions in a working memory (WM) load-dependent
  manner. However, to date, underlying neuronal mechanisms of these WM load-dependent
  activation changes in aging remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was
  to investigate these mechanisms in terms of effective connectivity by application
  of dynamic causal modeling with Bayesian Model Selection. Eighteen healthy younger
  (age: 20-32 years) and 32 older (60-75 years) participants performed an n-back task
  with 3 WM load levels during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Behavioral
  and conventional fMRI results replicated age group by WM load interactions. Importantly,
  the analysis of effective connectivity derived from dynamic causal modeling, indicated
  an age- and performance-related reduction in WM load-dependent modulation of connectivity
  from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to inferior parietal lobule. This finding provides
  evidence for the proposal that age-related WM decline manifests as deficient WM
  load-dependent modulation of neuronal top-down control and can integrate implications
  from theoretical models and previous studies of functional changes in the aging
  brain.'
