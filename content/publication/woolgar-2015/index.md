abstract: How do our brains achieve the cognitive control that is required for flexible
  behavior? Several models of cognitive control propose a role for frontoparietal
  cortex in the structure and representation of task sets or rules. For behavior to
  be flexible, however, the system must also rapidly reorganize as mental focus changes.
  Here we used multivoxel pattern analysis of fMRI data to demonstrate adaptive reorganization
  of frontoparietal activity patterns following a change in the complexity of the
  task rules. When task rules were relatively simple, frontoparietal cortex did not
  hold detectable information about these rules. In contrast, when the rules were
  more complex, frontoparietal cortex showed clear and decodable rule discrimination.
  Our data demonstrate that frontoparietal activity adjusts to task complexity, with
  better discrimination of rules that are behaviorally more confusable. The change
  in coding was specific to the rule element of the task and was not mirrored in more
  specialized cortex (early visual cortex) where coding was independent of difficulty.
  In line with an adaptive view of frontoparietal function, the data suggest a system
  that rapidly reconfigures in accordance with the difficulty of a behavioral task.
  This system may provide a neural basis for the flexible control of human behavior.
