abstract: "Theories of prospective memory (PM) posit that it can be subserved either
  by working memory (WM) or episodic memory (EM). Testing and refining these multiprocess
  theories of PM requires a way of tracking participants' reliance on WM versus EM.
  Here we use multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to derive a trial-by-trial measure
  of WM use in prospective memory. We manipulated strategy demands by varying the
  degree of proactive interference (which impairs EM) and the memory load required
  to perform the secondary task (which impairs WM). For the condition in which participants
  were pushed to rely more on WM, our MVPA measures showed 1) greater WM use and 2)
  a trial-by-trial correlation between WM use and PM behavior. Finally, we also showed
  that MVPA measures of WM use are not redundant with other behavioral measures: in
  the condition in which participants were pushed more to rely on WM, using neural
  and behavioral measures together led to better prediction of PM accuracy than either
  measure on its own."
