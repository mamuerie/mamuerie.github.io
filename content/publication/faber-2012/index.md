abstract: Mental fatigue is a form of fatigue, induced by continuous task performance.
  Mentally fatigued people often report having a hard time keeping their attention
  focussed and being easily distracted. In this study, we examined the relation between
  mental fatigue, as induced by time on task, and attention-related changes in event-related
  potentials (ERPs). EEG, reaction times and response accuracies were obtained from
  17 healthy volunteers during two hours of task performance on an adapted Eriksen
  flanker task. In this task, the size of targets and flankers was manipulated to
  discern neuronal processes that are related to processing of relevant information
  from processes related to the processing of irrelevant information. The ERP data
  showed that effects induced by target size manipulation were not affected by time
  on task, while an initial effect of flanker size manipulation decreased gradually
  with increasing time on task. We conclude that attention was affected by mental
  fatigue, in the form of a decrease in the ability to suppress irrelevant information.
  In behavioural results, this was reflected by a tendency of participants to increasingly
  base their response decision on irrelevant information, resulting in decreased response
  accuracies.
