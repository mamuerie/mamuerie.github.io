abstract: Both daily demands as well as training and competition characteristics in
  sports can result in a psychobiological state of mental fatigue leading to feelings
  of tiredness, lack of energy, an increased perception of effort, and performance
  decrements. Moreover, optimal performance will only be achievable if the balance
  between recovery and stress states is re-established. Consequently, recovery strategies
  are needed aiming at mental aspects of recovery. The aim of the study was to examine
  acute effects of potential mental recovery strategies (MR) on subjective-psychological
  and on cognitive performance outcomes after a mentally fatiguing task. A laboratory-based
  randomized cross-over study with twenty-four students (22.8 Â± 3.6 years) was applied.
  Participants were run through a powernap intervention (PN), a systematic breathing
  intervention (SB), a systematic breathing plus mental imagery intervention (SB+),
  and a control condition (CC) with one trial a week over four consecutive weeks.
  Mental fatigue was induced by completion of the 60-min version of the AX-continuous
  performance test (AX-CPT). The Short Recovery and Stress Scale (SRSS) and Visual
  Analog Scales (VAS) were assessed to measure effects on perceptual outcomes. Cognitive
  performance was measured with a reaction time test of the Vienna Test System (VTS).
  During all three recovery interventions and CC portable polysomnography was applied.
  Results showed a significant increase from pre-AX-CPT to pre-MR on fatigue states
  and recovery-stress states indicating that the induction of mental fatigue was effective.
  Moreover, results underlined that analysis yielded no significant differences between
  recovery interventions and the control condition but they revealed significant time
  effects for VAS, SRSS items, and cognitive performance. However, it could be derived
  that the application of a rest break with 20 min of mental recovery strategies appears
  to enhance recovery on a mainly mental and emotional level and to reduce perceived
  mental fatigue.
