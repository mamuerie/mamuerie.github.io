abstract: The sense of agency is a pervasive phenomenon that accompanies conscious
  acting and extends to the consequences of one's actions in the environment. Subjective
  feelings of agency are typically explained in terms of predictive processes, based
  on internal forward models inherent to the sensorimotor system, and postdictive
  processes, i.e., explicit, retrospective judgments by the agent. Only recently,
  research has begun to elucidate the link between sense of agency and more basic
  processes of human action control. The present study was conducted in this spirit
  and explored the relation between short-term action-effect binding and explicit
  agency judgments. We found evidence for such a link in that the participants' short-term
  action-effect binding predicted subsequent agency ratings. This offers a new perspective
  on the sense of agency, providing an additional mechanism (together with predictive
  and postdictive processes) that may underlie its formation.
