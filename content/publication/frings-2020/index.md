abstract: "Human action control relies on representations that integrate perception
  and action, but the relevant research is scattered over various experimental paradigms
  and the theorizing is overly paradigm-specific. To overcome this obstacle we propose
  BRAC (binding and retrieval in action control), an overarching, integrative framework
  that accounts for a wide range of seemingly unrelated findings by assuming 'two
  core processes: feature binding and retrieval'. In contrast to previous approaches,
  we define binding and retrieval as functionally different and separable processes
  that independently contribute to the observed effects. Furthermore, both processes
  are independently modulated by top-down and/or bottom-up processes. BRAC organizes
  the literature on action control in novel ways, and relates diverse independently
  investigated action-related phenomena from different research fields to each other."
