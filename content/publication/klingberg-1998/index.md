abstract: 'When two tasks are performed simultaneously, performance often deteriorates,
  with concomitant increases in reaction time and error rate. Three potential neurophysiological
  mechanisms behind this deterioration in performance have been considered here: (i)
  dual-task performance requires additional cognitive operations and activation of
  cortical areas in addition to those active during single-task performance; (ii)
  two tasks interfere if they require activation of the same part of cortex; and (iii)
  cross-modal inhibition causes interference between two tasks involving stimuli from
  different sensory modalities. Positron emission tomography was used to measure regional
  cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during performance of an auditory working memory (WM)
  task, a visual WM task, both WM tasks (dual task) and a control condition. Compared
  to the control condition, the auditory and visual WM tasks activated sensory-specific
  areas in the superior temporal gyrus and occipital pole respectively. Both WM tasks
  also activated overlapping parts of cortex in the dorsolateral prefrontal, inferior
  parietal and cingulate cortex. There was no separate cortical area which was activated
  only in the dual task, and thus no area which could be associated with any dual
  task specific cognitive process such as task-coordination or divided attention.
  Decrease in rCBF in one WM task did not overlap with the areas of rCBF increase
  in the other WM task. However, an inhibitory mechanism could not be ruled out, since
  the rCBF increase in sensory specific areas was smaller in the dual-task condition
  than in the single-task conditions. The cortical activity underlying WM was to a
  large extent organized in a non-sensory specific, or non-parallel, way, and the
  results are consistent with the hypothesis that concurrent tasks interfere with
  each other if they demand activation of the same part of cortex.'
