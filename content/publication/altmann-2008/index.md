abstract: A model of cognitive control in task switching is developed in which controlled
  performance depends on the system maintaining access to a code in episodic memory
  representing the most recently cued task. The main constraint on access to the current
  task code is proactive interference from old task codes. This interference and the
  mechanisms that contend with it reproduce a wide range of behavioral phenomena when
  simulated, including well-known task-switching effects, such as latency and error
  switch costs, and effects on which other theories are silent, such as with-run slowing
  and within-run error increase. The model generalizes across multiple task-switching
  procedures, suggesting that episodic task codes play an important role in keeping
  the cognitive system focused under a variety of performance constraints.
