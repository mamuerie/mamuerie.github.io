abstract: In this report, we examined the impact of rest breaks and goal switches
  on the vigilance decrement--the change in performance with time-on-task--and subjective
  stress and workload. In study 1, we examined the decrement in a visual line-length
  discrimination task employed in previous research. The task had a linear decrement
  in perceptual sensitivity with time-on-task based on the results of a trend analysis
  (orthogonal polynomial contrasts). In addition, the task had a profile of self-reported
  stress and workload similar to other moderately demanding vigilance tasks. In study
  2, we examined the decrement in the same task with the factorial inclusion of rest
  breaks and goal switches late in the task. The inclusion of rest breaks resulted
  in a significant cubic trend in perceptual sensitivity. After the first rest break,
  there was a reversal of the linear downward decrement in perceptual sensitivity,
  but the second rest break did not elicit this change. The inclusion of goal switches
  did not cause any significant deviation from the linear trend and did not attenuate
  the decrement. In addition, the inclusion of rest breaks resulted in reduced self-reported
  effort and temporal demand. The results of the present study cohere with the expectations
  of a resource depletion account of the vigilance decrement.
