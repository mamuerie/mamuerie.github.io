abstract: Previous research has indicated that modality switching is considerably
  affected by modality compatibility. It has been shown that switch costs are higher
  for switching between relatively incompatible sensory-motor modality mappings (i.e.,
  auditory-manual and visual-vocal) compared to switching between compatible mappings
  (i.e., auditory-vocal and visual-manual). So far, however, it has been unclear whether
  these findings are influenced by learning processes resulting from very small stimulus
  sets and a large number of stimulus repetitions. In the present study, we investigated
  the role of learning concept-to-category associations (Experiment 1) as well as
  influences of learning concept-to-modality mappings (Experiment 2) on sensory-motor
  modality switching in semantic categorizations. The results of both experiments
  revealed shorter overall reaction times due to learning. Additionally, learning
  of concept-to-category associations (Experiment 1) led to a significant reduction
  of modality switch costs. Interestingly, however, modality-compatibility effects
  were neither significantly influenced by learning of concept-to-category associations
  nor by learning of concept-to-modality mappings. Thus, the present study provides
  first evidence that learning on the semantic level influences modality switching
  but it does not significantly affect modality compatibility.
