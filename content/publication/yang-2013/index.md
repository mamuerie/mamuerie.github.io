abstract: Individuals frequently experience mental fatigue during or after prolonged
  periods of cognitive activity. We investigated the effects of mental fatigue on
  the ability to detect minor changes in the pre-attentive stage of information processing
  by recoding MMN of ERP components. The equal probable paradigm was employed to elicit
  pure memory-comparison-based MMN component. Mental fatigue was induced by the continuous
  performance for 2h of mental arithmetic tasks. MMN amplitudes at fronto-central
  electrode sites were significantly decreased in subjects with mental fatigue than
  in subjects under control conditions, whereas temporal MMN was not affected by mental
  fatigue. These results suggest that mental fatigue impairs pre-attentive processing.
