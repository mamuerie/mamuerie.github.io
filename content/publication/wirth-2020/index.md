abstract: Performance is typically superior with modality-compatible stimulus-response
  sets (e.g., responding vocally to auditory stimuli and manually to visual stimuli)
  than with modality-incompatible sets (e.g., responding vocally to visual stimuli
  and manually to auditory stimuli). Here we studied the information-processing stage
  at which these modality compatibility effects arise. In three experiments using
  a dual-task setup, we demonstrated that these compatibility effects arose (at least
  partly) prior to a capacity-limited central stage that is commonly believed to be
  the origin of dual-task costs. We suggest that demands to employ a specific effector
  system bias perceptual processing toward effector-compatible stimulus modalities.
