abstract: The negative effects of extremely competitive academic and research environments
  on the performance and health of researchers are well known and common worldwide.
  The prevalence of these effects, particularly among early career researchers, calls
  for a more humane and people-centered way of working within research labs. Although
  there is growing concern about the urgent need for a better lifeâ€“work balance when
  doing science, there are not many examples about how this could be achieved in practice.
  In this article, I introduce 10 simple rules to make the working environment of
  research labs more nurturing, collaborative, and people-centered. These rules are
  directed towards existing and future principal investigators (PIs) but will be of
  interest to anyone working in a research lab and/or dealing with how to improve
  working conditions for scientists.
