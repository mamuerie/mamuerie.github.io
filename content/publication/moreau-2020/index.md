abstract: 'Psychology researchers are rapidly adopting open science practices, yet
  clear guidelines on how to apply these practices to meta-analysis remain lacking.
  In this tutorial, we describe why open science is important in the context of meta-analysis
  in psychology, and suggest how to adopt the 3 main components of open science: preregistration,
  open materials, and open data. We first describe how to make the preregistration
  as thorough as possible-and how to handle deviations from the plan. We then focus
  on creating easy-to-read materials (e.g., search syntax, R scripts) to facilitate
  reproducibility and bolster the impact of a meta-analysis. Finally, we suggest how
  to organize data (e.g., literature search results, data extracted from studies)
  that are easy to share, interpret, and update as new studies emerge. For each step
  of the meta-analysis, we provide example templates, accompanied by brief video tutorials,
  and show how to integrate these practices into the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/q8stz/).
