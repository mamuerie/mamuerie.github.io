abstract: The brain is an inherently dynamic system, and executive cognition requires
  dynamically reconfiguring, highly evolving networks of brain regions that interact
  in complex and transient communication patterns. However, a precise characterization
  of these reconfiguration processes during cognitive function in humans remains elusive.
  Here, we use a series of techniques developed in the field of \"dynamic network
  neuroscience\" to investigate the dynamics of functional brain networks in 344 healthy
  subjects during a working-memory challenge (the \"n-back\" task). In contrast to
  a control condition, in which dynamic changes in cortical networks were spread evenly
  across systems, the effortful working-memory condition was characterized by a reconfiguration
  of frontoparietal and frontotemporal networks. This reconfiguration, which characterizes
  \"network flexibility,\" employs transient and heterogeneous connectivity between
  frontal systems, which we refer to as \"integration.\" Frontal integration predicted
  neuropsychological measures requiring working memory and executive cognition, suggesting
  that dynamic network reconfiguration between frontal systems supports those functions.
  Our results characterize dynamic reconfiguration of large-scale distributed neural
  circuits during executive cognition in humans and have implications for understanding
  impaired cognitive function in disorders affecting connectivity, such as schizophrenia
  or dementia.
