abstract: Cognitive decline is a major concern in the aging population. It is normative
  to experience some deterioration in cognitive abilities with advanced age such as
  related to memory performance, attention distraction to interference, task switching,
  and processing speed. However, intact cognitive functioning in old age is important
  for leading an independent day-to-day life. Thus, studying ways to counteract or
  delay the onset of cognitive decline in aging is crucial. The literature offers
  various explanations for the decline in cognitive performance in aging; among those
  are age-related gray and white matter atrophy, synaptic degeneration, blood flow
  reduction, neurochemical alterations, and change in connectivity patterns with advanced
  age. An emerging literature on neurofeedback and Brain Computer Interface (BCI)
  reports exciting results supporting the benefits of volitional modulation of brain
  activity on cognition and behavior. Neurofeedback studies based on real-time functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) have shown behavioral changes in schizophrenia
  and behavioral benefits in nicotine addiction. This article integrates research
  on cognitive and brain aging with evidence of brain and behavioral modification
  due to rtfMRI neurofeedback. We offer a state-of-the-art description of the rtfMRI
  technique with an eye towards its application in aging. We present preliminary results
  of a feasibility study exploring the possibility of using rtfMRI to train older
  adults to volitionally control brain activity. Based on these first findings, we
  discuss possible implementations of rtfMRI neurofeedback as a novel technique to
  study and alleviate cognitive decline in healthy and pathological aging.
