abstract: Complex functional brain networks are large networks of brain regions and
  functional brain connections. Statistical characterizations of these networks aim
  to quantify global and local properties of brain activity with a small number of
  network measures. Important functional network measures include measures of modularity
  (measures of the goodness with which a network is optimally partitioned into functional
  subgroups) and measures of centrality (measures of the functional influence of individual
  brain regions). Characterizations of functional networks are increasing in popularity,
  but are associated with several important methodological problems. These problems
  include the inability to characterize densely connected and weighted functional
  networks, the neglect of degenerate topologically distinct high-modularity partitions
  of these networks, and the absence of a network null model for testing hypotheses
  of association between observed nontrivial network properties and simple weighted
  connectivity properties. In this study we describe a set of methods to overcome
  these problems. Specifically, we generalize measures of modularity and centrality
  to fully connected and weighted complex networks, describe the detection of degenerate
  high-modularity partitions of these networks, and introduce a weighted-connectivity
  null model of these networks. We illustrate our methods by demonstrating degenerate
  high-modularity partitions and strong correlations between two complementary measures
  of centrality in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) networks
  from the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project, an open-access repository of resting-state
  functional MRI datasets. Our methods may allow more sound and reliable characterizations
  and comparisons of functional brain networks across conditions and subjects.
