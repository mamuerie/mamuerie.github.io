abstract: Our ability to multitask-focus on multiple tasks simultaneously-is one of
  the most critical functions of our cognitive system. This capability has shown to
  have relations to cognition and personality in empirical studies, which have received
  much attention recently. This review article integrates the available findings to
  examine how individual differences in multitasking behavior are linked with different
  cognitive constructs and personality traits to conceptualize what multitasking behavior
  represents. In this review, we highlight the methodological differences and theoretical
  conceptions. Cognitive constructs including executive functions (i.e., shifting,
  updating, and inhibition), working memory, relational integration, divided attention,
  reasoning, and prospective memory were investigated. Concerning personality, the
  traits of polychronicity, impulsivity, and the five-factor model were considered.
  A total of 43 studies met the inclusion criteria and entered the review. The research
  synthesis directs us to propose two new conceptual models to explain multitasking
  behavior as a psychometric construct. The first model demonstrates that individual
  differences in multitasking behavior can be explained by cognitive abilities. The
  second model proposes that personality traits constitute a moderating effect on
  the relation between multitasking behavior and cognition. Finally, we provide possible
  future directions for the line of research.
