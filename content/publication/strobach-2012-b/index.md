abstract: In the task-switching paradigm, mixing costs indicate the performance costs
  to mix two different tasks, while switch costs indicate the performance costs to
  switch between two sequentially presented tasks. Applying tasks with bivalent stimuli
  and responses, many studies demonstrated substantial mixing and switch costs and
  a reduction of these costs as a result of practice. The present study investigates
  whether extensive practice of a task-switching situation including tasks with univalent
  stimuli eliminates these costs. Participants practiced switching between a visual
  and an auditory task. These tasks were chosen because they had shown eliminated
  performance costs in a comparable dual-task practice study (Schumacher et al. Psychol
  Sci 12:101-108, 2001). Participants either performed the tasks with univalent responses
  (i.e., visual-manual and auditory-verbal stimulus-response mappings) or bivalent
  responses (i.e., visual-manual and auditory-manual stimulus-response mappings).
  Both valence conditions revealed substantial mixing and switch costs at the beginning
  of practice, yet, mixing costs were largely eliminated after eight practice sessions
  while switch costs were still existent.
