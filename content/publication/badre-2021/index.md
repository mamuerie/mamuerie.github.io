abstract: "Cognitive control allows us to think and behave flexibly based on our context
  and goals. At the heart of theories of cognitive control is a control representation
  that enables the same input to produce different outputs contingent on contextual
  factors. In this review, we focus on an important property of the control representation's
  neural code: its representational dimensionality. Dimensionality of a neural representation
  balances a basic separability/generalizability trade-off in neural computation.
  We will discuss the implications of this trade-off for cognitive control. We will
  then briefly review current neuroscience findings regarding the dimensionality of
  control representations in the brain, particularly the prefrontal cortex. We conclude
  by highlighting open questions and crucial directions for future research."
