abstract: "Recent work shows that models based on functional connectivity in large-scale
  brain networks can predict individuals' attentional abilities. While being some
  of the first generalizable neuromarkers of cognitive function, these models also
  inform our basic understanding of attention, providing empirical evidence that:
  (i) attention is a network property of brain computation; (ii) the functional architecture
  that underlies attention can be measured while people are not engaged in any explicit
  task; and (iii) this architecture supports a general attentional ability that is
  common to several laboratory-based tasks and is impaired in attention deficit hyperactivity
  disorder (ADHD). Looking ahead, connectivity-based predictive models of attention
  and other cognitive abilities and behaviors may potentially improve the assessment,
  diagnosis, and treatment of clinical dysfunction."
