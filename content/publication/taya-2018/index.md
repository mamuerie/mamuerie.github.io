abstract: Fronto-parietal subnetworks were revealed to compensate for cognitive decline
  due to mental fatigue by community structure analysis. Here, we investigate changes
  in topology of subnetworks of resting-state fMRI networks due to mental fatigue
  induced by prolonged performance of a cognitively demanding task, and their associations
  with cognitive decline. As it is well established that brain networks have modular
  organization, community structure analyses can provide valuable information about
  mesoscale network organization and serve as a bridge between standard fMRI approaches
  and brain connectomics that quantify the topology of whole brain networks. We developed
  inter- and intramodule network metrics to quantify topological characteristics of
  subnetworks, based on our hypothesis that mental fatigue would impact on functional
  relationships of subnetworks. Functional networks were constructed with wavelet
  correlation and a data-driven thresholding scheme based on orthogonal minimum spanning
  trees, which allowed detection of communities with weak connections. A change from
  pre- to posttask runs was found for the intermodule density between the frontal
  and the temporal subnetworks. Seven inter- or intramodule network metrics, mostly
  at the frontal or the parietal subnetworks, showed significant predictive power
  of individual cognitive decline, while the network metrics for the whole network
  were less effective in the predictions. Our results suggest that the control-type
  fronto-parietal networks have a flexible topological architecture to compensate
  for declining cognitive ability due to mental fatigue. This community structure
  analysis provides valuable insight into connectivity dynamics under different cognitive
  states including mental fatigue.
