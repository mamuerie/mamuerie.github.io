abstract: Control of thought and behavior is fundamental to human intelligence. Evidence
  suggests a frontoparietal brain network implements such cognitive control across
  diverse contexts. We identify a mechanism--global connectivity--by which components
  of this network might coordinate control of other networks. A lateral prefrontal
  cortex (LPFC) region's activity was found to predict performance in a high control
  demand working memory task and also to exhibit high global connectivity. Critically,
  global connectivity in this LPFC region, involving connections both within and outside
  the frontoparietal network, showed a highly selective relationship with individual
  differences in fluid intelligence. These findings suggest LPFC is a global hub with
  a brainwide influence that facilitates the ability to implement control processes
  central to human intelligence.
