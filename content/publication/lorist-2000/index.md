abstract: The effects of mental fatigue on planning and preparation for future actions
  were examined, using a task switching paradigm. Fatigue was induced by \"time on
  task,\" with subjects performing a switch task continuously for 2 hr. Subjects had
  to alternate between tasks on every second trial, so that a new task set was required
  on every second trial. Manipulations of response-stimulus intervals (RSIs) were
  used to examine whether subjects prepared themselves for the task change. Behavioral
  measurements, event-related potentials (ERPs), and mood questionnaires were used
  to assess the effects of mental fatigue. Reaction times (RTs) were faster on trials
  in which no change in task set was required in comparison with switch trials, requiring
  a new task set. Long RSIs were used efficiently to prepare for the processing of
  subsequent stimuli. With increasing mental fatigue, preparation processes seemed
  to become less adequate and the number of errors increased. A clear poststimulus
  parietal negativity was observed on repetition trials, which reduced with time on
  task. This attention-related component was less pronounced in switch trials; instead,
  ERPs elicited in switch trials showed a clear frontal negativity. This negativity
  was also diminished by time on task. ERP differences between repetition and switch
  trials became smaller with increasing time on task.
