abstract: There is no consensus regarding the origin of behavioral interference that
  occurs during concurrent multitasking. Some evidence points toward a multitasking
  locus in the brain, while other results imply that interference is the consequence
  of task interactions in several brain regions. To investigate this issue, we conducted
  a functional MRI (fMRI) study consisting of three component tasks, which were performed
  both separately and in combination. The results indicated that no specific multitasking
  area exists. Instead, different patterns of activation across conditions could be
  explained by assuming that the interference is a result of task interactions. Additionally,
  similarity in single-task activation patterns correlated with a decrease in accuracy
  during dual-task conditions. Taken together, these results support the view that
  multitasking interference is not due to a bottleneck in a single \"multitasking\"
  brain region, but is a result of interactions between concurrently running processes.
