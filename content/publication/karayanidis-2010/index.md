abstract: Recent research has taken advantage of the temporal and spatial resolution
  of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and functional magnetic resonance imaging
  (fMRI) to identify the time course and neural circuitry of preparatory processes
  required to switch between different tasks. Here we overview some key findings contributing
  to understanding strategic processes in advance preparation. Findings from these
  methodologies are compatible with advance preparation conceptualized as a set of
  processes activated for both switch and repeat trials, but with substantial variability
  as a function of individual differences and task requirements. We then highlight
  new approaches that attempt to capitalize on this variability to link behavior and
  brain activation patterns. One approach examines correlations among behavioral,
  ERP and fMRI measures. A second \"model-based\" approach accounts for differences
  in preparatory processes by estimating quantitative model parameters that reflect
  latent psychological processes. We argue that integration of behavioral and neuroscientific
  methodologies is key to understanding the complex nature of advance preparation
  in task-switching.
