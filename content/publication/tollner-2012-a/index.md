abstract: Over the last decades, the visual-search paradigm has provided a powerful
  test bed for competing theories of visual selective attention. However, the information
  required to decide upon the correct motor response differs fundamentally across
  experimental studies, being based, for example, on the presence, spatial location,
  or identity of the target item. This variability raises the question as to whether
  estimates of the time taken for (i) focal-attentional selection, (ii) deciding on
  the motor response, and (iii) response execution generalize across search studies
  or are specific to the demands of a particular task set. To examine this issue,
  we presented physically identical stimulus material in four different search task
  conditions, requiring target localization, detection, discrimination, or compound
  responses, and combined mental chronometry with two specific electroencephalographic
  brain responses that are directly linkable to either preattentive or postselective
  levels of visual processing. Behaviorally, reactions were fastest for localization,
  slowest for compound responses, and of intermediate speed for detection and discrimination
  responses. At the electroencephalographic level, this effect of task type manifested
  in the timing of the stimulus- and response-locked lateralized readiness potential
  (indexing motor-response decisions), but not posterior contralateral negativity
  (indexing focal-attentional selection), component. This result demonstrates that
  only the stage of preattentive visual coding generalizes across task settings, whereas
  processes that follow focal target selection are dependent on the nature of the
  task. Consequently, this task set-specific pattern has fundamental implications
  for all types of experimental paradigms, within and beyond visual search, that require
  humans to generate motor responses on the basis of external sensory stimulation.
