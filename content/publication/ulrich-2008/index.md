abstract: Response grouping is a ubiquitous phenomenon in psychological refractory
  period (PRP) tasks, yet it hampers the analysis of dual-task performance. To account
  for response grouping, we developed several extended versions of the standard bottleneck
  model, each of which incorporates a possible grouping mechanism into this model.
  Computer simulations were used to assess how the predictions of the standard model
  would change with each grouping mechanism. One set of simulations investigated the
  basic effects of grouping on the means and intercorrelation of the reaction times
  in the two tasks, as well as the percentage of trials with short interresponse times
  (IRTs). A second set of simulations examined whether response grouping would invalidate
  the use of PRP paradigms for localizing experimental effects. Finally, we investigated
  whether the post-hoc elimination of trials with short IRTs removes the contaminating
  effects of response grouping.
