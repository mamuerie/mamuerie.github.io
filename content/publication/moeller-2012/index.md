abstract: 'Dopamine modulates executive function, including sustaining cognitive control
  during mental fatigue. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging
  (fMRI) during the color-word Stroop task, we aimed to model mental fatigue with
  repeated task exposures in 33 cocaine abusers and 20 healthy controls. During such
  mental fatigue (indicated by increased errors, and decreased post-error slowing
  and dorsal anterior cingulate response to error as a function of time-on-task),
  healthy individuals showed increased activity in the dopaminergic midbrain to error.
  Cocaine abusers, characterized by disrupted dopamine neurotransmission, showed an
  opposite pattern of response. This midbrain fMRI activity with repetition was further
  correlated with objective indices of endogenous motivation in all subjects: a state
  measure (task reaction time) and a trait measure (dopamine D2 receptor availability
  in caudate, as revealed by positron emission tomography data collected in a subset
  of this sample, which directly points to a contribution of dopamine to these results).
  In a second sample of 14 cocaine abusers and 15 controls, administration of an indirect
  dopamine agonist, methylphenidate, reversed these midbrain responses in both groups,
  possibly indicating normalization of response in cocaine abusers because of restoration
  of dopamine signaling but degradation of response in healthy controls owing to excessive
  dopamine signaling. Together, these multimodal imaging findings suggest a novel
  involvement of the dopaminergic midbrain in sustaining motivation during fatigue.
  This region might provide a useful target for strengthening self-control and/or
  endogenous motivation in addiction.'
