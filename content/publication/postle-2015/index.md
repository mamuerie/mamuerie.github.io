abstract: 'Our understanding of the neural bases of visual short-term memory (STM),
  the ability to mentally retain information over short periods of time, is being
  reshaped by two important developments: the application of methods from statistical
  machine learning, often a variant of multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), to functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalographic (EEG) data sets; and
  advances in our understanding of the physiology and functions of neuronal oscillations.
  One consequence is that many commonly observed physiological \"signatures\" that
  have previously been interpreted as directly related to the retention of information
  in visual STM may require reinterpretation as more general, state-related changes
  that can accompany cognitive-task performance. Another is important refinements
  of theoretical models of visual STM.'
