abstract: 'Subject-specific artifacts caused by head motion and physiological noise
  are major confounds in BOLD fMRI analyses. However, there is little consensus on
  the optimal choice of data preprocessing steps to minimize these effects. To evaluate
  the effects of various preprocessing strategies, we present a framework which comprises
  a combination of (1) nonparametric testing including reproducibility and prediction
  metrics of the data-driven NPAIRS framework (Strother et al. [2002]: NeuroImage
  15:747-771), and (2) intersubject comparison of SPM effects, using DISTATIS (a three-way
  version of metric multidimensional scaling (Abdi et al. [2009]: NeuroImage 45:89-95).
  It is shown that the quality of brain activation maps may be significantly limited
  by sub-optimal choices of data preprocessing steps (or \"pipeline\") in a clinical
  task-design, an fMRI adaptation of the widely used Trail-Making Test. The relative
  importance of motion correction, physiological noise correction, motion parameter
  regression, and temporal detrending were examined for fMRI data acquired in young,
  healthy adults. Analysis performance and the quality of activation maps were evaluated
  based on Penalized Discriminant Analysis (PDA). The relative importance of different
  preprocessing steps was assessed by (1) a nonparametric Friedman rank test for fixed
  sets of preprocessing steps, applied to all subjects; and (2) evaluating pipelines
  chosen specifically for each subject. Results demonstrate that preprocessing choices
  have significant, but subject-dependant effects, and that individually-optimized
  pipelines may significantly improve the reproducibility of fMRI results over fixed
  pipelines. This was demonstrated by the detection of a significant interaction with
  motion parameter regression and physiological noise correction, even though the
  range of subject head motion was small across the group (≪ 1 voxel). Optimizing
  pipelines on an individual-subject basis also revealed brain activation patterns
  either weak or absent under fixed pipelines, which has implications for the overall
  interpretation of fMRI data, and the relative importance of preprocessing methods.'
