abstract: In two studies, participants performed a switching task, and we provided
  to only half of them feedback on goal progress (how much of the task still remains).
  Importantly, this feedback did not inform participants on how well they performed.
  We found that participants in the feedback condition achieved a higher asymptotic
  level of performance, reported less fatigue and took shorter breaks between blocks
  compared to the control condition. These results suggest that asymptotic level of
  performance reflects not only ability (as is commonly assumed in the literature)
  but also motivation. We suggest that when people know when a focal task would end,
  they invest more effort in it because foregoing other activities becomes less costly
  (i.e., opportunity cost of engaging in the focal activity decreases) and because
  knowing when a task would end frees the actor from the need to conserve effort.
  These results suggest a simple, effective and costless way to improve cognitive
  performance that may be applied in educational and organizational settings.
