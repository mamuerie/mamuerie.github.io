abstract: We used fMRI to investigate both common and differential neural mechanisms
  underlying two distinct types of switching requirements, namely switching between
  stimulus categorizations (color vs. form) and switching between response modalities
  (hand vs. foot responses). Both types of switching induced similar behavioral shift
  costs. However, at the neural level, switching between stimulus categorizations
  led to left-hemispheric activations including the inferior frontal gyrus as well
  as the intraparietal sulcus extending to the superior parietal gyrus and the supramarginal
  gyrus. In contrast, switching between response modalities was associated mainly
  with left-hemispheric activation of the intraparietal sulcus and the supramarginal
  gyrus. A conjunction analysis indicated common activation of the left intraparietal
  sulcus and the supramarginal gyrus for both types of switching. Together, these
  results qualify previous claims about a general role of the left prefrontal cortex
  in task control by suggesting that the left inferior frontal gyrus is specifically
  involved in switching between stimulus categorizations, whereas parietal cortex
  is more generally implicated in the selection of action rules.
