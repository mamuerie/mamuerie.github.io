abstract: Enhanced procedural learning has been evidenced in conditions where cognitive
  control is diminished, including hypnosis, disruption of prefrontal activity and
  non-optimal time of the day. Another condition depleting the availability of controlled
  resources is cognitive fatigue (CF). We tested the hypothesis that CF, eventually
  leading to diminished cognitive control, facilitates procedural sequence learning.
  In a two-day experiment, 23 young healthy adults were administered a serial reaction
  time task (SRTT) following the induction of high or low levels of CF, in a counterbalanced
  order. CF was induced using the Time load Dual-back (TloadDback) paradigm, a dual
  working memory task that allows tailoring cognitive load levels to the individual's
  optimal performance capacity. In line with our hypothesis, reaction times (RT) in
  the SRTT were faster in the high- than in the low-level fatigue condition, and performance
  improvement was higher for the sequential than the motor components. Altogether,
  our results suggest a paradoxical, facilitating impact of CF on procedural motor
  sequence learning. We propose that facilitated learning in the high-level fatigue
  condition stems from a reduction in the cognitive resources devoted to cognitive
  control processes that normally oppose automatic procedural acquisition mechanisms.
