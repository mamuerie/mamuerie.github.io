abstract: Deleterious consequences of cognitive fatigue might be avoided if people
  respond with increased effort to increased demands. In this study, we hypothesized
  that the effects of fatigue would be more pronounced in cognitive functions reflecting
  compensatory effort. Given that the P3a event-related potential is sensitive to
  the direction and amount of attention allocated to a stimulus array, we reasoned
  that compensatory effort would manifest in increased P3a amplitudes. Therefore,
  we compared P3a before (pre-test) and after (post-test) a 2~h long cognitively demanding
  (fatigue group, n,=,18) or undemanding task (control group, n,=,18). Two auditory
  tasks, a three-stimulus novelty oddball and a duration discrimination two-choice
  response task were presented to elicit P3a. In the fatigue group, we used the multi-attribute
  task battery as a fatigue-inducing task. This task draws on a broad array of attentional
  functions and imposed considerable workload. The control group watched mood-neutral
  documentary films. The fatigue manipulation was effective as subjective fatigue
  increased significantly in the fatigue group compared to controls. Contrary to expectations,
  however, fatigue failed to affect P3a in the post-test phase. Similar null effects
  were obtained for other neurobehavioral measures (P3b and behavioral performance).
  Results indicate that a moderate increase in subjective fatigue does not hinder
  cognitive functions profoundly. The lack of objective performance loss in the present
  study suggests that the cognitive system can be resilient against challenges instigated
  by demanding task performance.
