abstract: The past two decades have witnessed an explosion of interest in the cognitive
  and neural mechanisms of adaptive control processes that operate in selective attention
  tasks. This has spawned a large empirical literature and several theories, but also
  recurring identification of potential confounds and corresponding adjustments in
  task design to create confound-minimized metrics of adaptive control. The resultant
  complexity of this literature can be difficult to navigate for new researchers entering
  this field, leading to sub-optimal study designs. To remediate this problem, we
  here present a consensus view among opposing theorists that specifies how researchers
  can measure four hallmark indices of adaptive control (the congruency sequence effect,
  and the list-wide, context-specific, and item-specific proportion congruency effects)
  while minimizing easy-to-overlook confounds.
