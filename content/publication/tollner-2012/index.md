abstract: Visual search for feature singletons is slowed when a task-irrelevant, but
  more salient distracter singleton is concurrently presented. While there is a consensus
  that this distracter interference effect can be influenced by internal system settings,
  it remains controversial at what stage of processing this influence starts to affect
  visual coding. Advocates of the ‘‘stimulus-driven’’ view maintain that the initial
  sweep of visual processing is entirely driven by physical stimulus attributes and
  that top-down settings can bias visual processing only after selection of the most
  salient item. By contrast, opponents argue that top-down expectancies can alter
  the initial selection priority, so that focal attention is ‘‘not automatically’’
  shifted to the location exhibiting the highest feature contrast. To precisely trace
  the allocation of focal attention, we analyzed the Posterior-Contralateral-Negativity
  (PCN) in a task in which the likelihood (expectancy) with which a distracter occurred
  was systematically varied. Our results show that both high (vs. low) distracter
  expectancy and experiencing a distracter on the previous trial speed up the timing
  of the targetelicited PCN. Importantly, there was no distracter-elicited PCN, indicating
  that participants did not shift attention to the distracter before selecting the
  target. This pattern unambiguously demonstrates that preattentive vision is top-down
  modifiable.
