abstract: A neglected question regarding cognitive control is how control processes
  might detect situations calling for their involvement. The authors propose here
  that the demand for control may be evaluated in part by monitoring for conflicts
  in information processing. This hypothesis is supported by data concerning the anterior
  cingulate cortex, a brain area involved in cognitive control, which also appears
  to respond to the occurrence of conflict. The present article reports two computational
  modeling studies, serving to articulate the conflict monitoring hypothesis and examine
  its implications. The first study tests the sufficiency of the hypothesis to account
  for brain activation data, applying a measure of conflict to existing models of
  tasks shown to engage the anterior cingulate. The second study implements a feedback
  loop connecting conflict monitoring to cognitive control, using this to simulate
  a number of important behavioral phenomena.
