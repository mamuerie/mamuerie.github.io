abstract: Sensory-motor modality compatibility is defined as the similarity between
  the sensory modality and the modality of response-related effects. Previous dual-task
  and task-switching studies have shown higher performance costs for coordinating
  relatively incompatible sensory-motor modality mappings (i.e., auditory-manual and
  visual-vocal) compared to more compatible mappings (i.e., auditory-vocal and visual-manual).
  Until now, however, little attention has been paid to potential variability in effects
  of modality compatibility depending on different processing codes. In the present
  study, we independently varied the processing codes of input and output (nonverbal-spatial,
  nonverbal-nominal, verbal-spatial, verbal-nominal) while participants switched between
  incompatible and compatible sensory-motor modality mappings. Beside higher switch
  costs for switching between incompatible sensory-motor modality mappings than for
  switching between compatible mappings, the results revealed stronger effects of
  modality compatibility on switch costs for verbal input than for nonverbal input
  codes. This suggests that priming mechanisms between sensory input and compatible
  motor output are modulated by the processing code of the sensory input. As possible
  explanations, we assume a higher degree of concordance with output processing codes
  as well as stronger associations with potential response effects for verbal than
  for nonverbal input.
