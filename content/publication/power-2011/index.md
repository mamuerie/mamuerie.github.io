abstract: 'Real-world complex systems may be mathematically modeled as graphs, revealing
  properties of the system. Here we study graphs of functional brain organization
  in healthy adults using resting state functional connectivity MRI. We propose two
  novel brain-wide graphs, one of 264 putative functional areas, the other a modification
  of voxelwise networks that eliminates potentially artificial short-distance relationships.
  These graphs contain many subgraphs in good agreement with known functional brain
  systems. Other subgraphs lack established functional identities; we suggest possible
  functional characteristics for these subgraphs. Further, graph measures of the areal
  network indicate that the default mode subgraph shares network properties with sensory
  and motor subgraphs: it is internally integrated but isolated from other subgraphs,
  much like a \"processing\" system. The modified voxelwise graph also reveals spatial
  motifs in the patterning of systems across the cortex.'
