abstract: 'Cognitive fatigue and boredom are two phenomenological states that reflect
  overt task disengagement. In this paper, we present a rational analysis of the temporal
  structure of controlled behavior, which provides a formal account of these phenomena.
  We suggest that in controlling behavior, the brain faces competing behavioral and
  computational imperatives, and must balance them by tracking their opportunity costs
  over time. We use this analysis to flesh out previous suggestions that feelings
  associated with subjective effort, like cognitive fatigue and boredom, are the phenomenological
  counterparts of these opportunity cost measures, instead of reflecting the depletion
  of resources as has often been assumed. Specifically, we propose that both fatigue
  and boredom reflect the competing value of particular options that require foregoing
  immediate reward but can improve future performance: Fatigue reflects the value
  of offline computation (internal to the organism) to improve future decisions, while
  boredom signals the value of exploration (external in the world). We demonstrate
  that these accounts provide a mechanistically explicit and parsimonious account
  for a wide array of findings related to cognitive control, integrating and reimagining
  them under a single, formally rigorous framework.Competing Interest StatementThe
  authors have declared no competing interest.'
