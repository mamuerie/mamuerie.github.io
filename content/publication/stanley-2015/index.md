abstract: Working memory is a complex psychological construct referring to the temporary
  storage and active processing of information. We used functional connectivity brain
  network metrics quantifying local and global efficiency of information transfer
  for predicting individual variability in working memory performance on an n-back
  task in both young (n = 14) and older (n = 15) adults. Individual differences in
  both local and global efficiency during the working memory task were significant
  predictors of working memory performance in addition to age (and an interaction
  between age and global efficiency). Decreases in local efficiency during the working
  memory task were associated with better working memory performance in both age cohorts.
  In contrast, increases in global efficiency were associated with much better working
  performance for young participants; however, increases in global efficiency were
  associated with a slight decrease in working memory performance for older participants.
  Individual differences in local and global efficiency during resting-state sessions
  were not significant predictors of working memory performance. Significant group
  whole-brain functional network decreases in local efficiency also were observed
  during the working memory task compared to rest, whereas no significant differences
  were observed in network global efficiency. These results are discussed in relation
  to recently developed models of age-related differences in working memory.
