abstract: 'Task representations consist of different aspects such as the representations
  of the relevant stimuli, the abstract rules to be applied, and the actions to be
  performed. To be flexible in our daily lives, we frequently need to switch between
  some or all aspects of a task. In the present study, we examined whether switching
  between abstract task rules and switching between response hands is associated with
  overlapping regions in the posterior lateral frontal cortex and whether switching
  between these two aspects of a task representation is neurally implemented by distinct
  functional brain networks. Subjects performed a cue-based task-switching paradigm
  where the location of the task cue additionally specified the response hand to be
  used. Overlapping activity for switching between abstract rules versus response
  hands was present in the inferior frontal junction area of the posterolateral frontal
  cortex. This region, however, showed very distinct patterns of functional connectivity
  depending on the content of the switch: Increased functional connectivity with anterior
  prefrontal, superior frontal, and hippocampal regions was present for abstract rule
  switching, whereas response hand switching led to increased coupling with motor
  regions surrounding the central sulcus. These results reveal that a rather general
  involvement of the posterior lateral frontal cortex in different switching contexts
  can be further characterized by highly specific functional interactions with other
  task-relevant regions, depending on the content of the switch.'
