abstract: We examined the effect of cognitive fatigue on the Attention Networks Test
  (ANT). Participants were 228 non-demented older adults. Cognitive fatigue was operationally
  defined as decline in alerting, orienting, and executive attention performance over
  the course of the ANT. Anchored in a theoretical model implicating the frontal basal
  ganglia circuitry as the core substrate of fatigue, we hypothesized that cognitive
  fatigue would be observed only in executive attention. Consistent with our prediction,
  significant cognitive fatigue effect was observed in executive attention but not
  in alerting or orienting. In contrast, orienting improved over the course of the
  ANT and alerting showed a trend, though insignificant, that was consistent with
  learning. Cognitive fatigue is conceptualized as an executive failure to maintain
  and optimize performance over acute but sustained cognitive effort resulting in
  performance that is lower and more variable than the individual's optimal ability.
