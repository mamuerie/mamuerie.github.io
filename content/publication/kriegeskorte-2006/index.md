abstract: 'The development of high-resolution neuroimaging and multielectrode electrophysiological
  recording provides neuroscientists with huge amounts of multivariate data. The complexity
  of the data creates a need for statistical summary, but the local averaging standardly
  applied to this end may obscure the effects of greatest neuroscientific interest.
  In neuroimaging, for example, brain mapping analysis has focused on the discovery
  of activation, i.e., of extended brain regions whose average activity changes across
  experimental conditions. Here we propose to ask a more general question of the data:
  Where in the brain does the activity pattern contain information about the experimental
  condition? To address this question, we propose scanning the imaged volume with
  a \"searchlight,\" whose contents are analyzed multivariately at each location in
  the brain.'
