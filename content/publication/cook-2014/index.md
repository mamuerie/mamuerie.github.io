abstract: Research has suggested that prospective memory retrieval is reliant on executive
  control processes, and the degree to which these processes are necessary for intention
  fulfillment is dependent on a host of variables related to the prospective memory
  task. Based on results suggesting that aspects of the prospective memory task vary
  in their need for executive control, the current study examined the possibility
  that executive control depletion from the Stroop task would negatively transfer
  to prospective memory performance. Depletion of executive control, measured objectively
  in a Stroop task, did not impair prospective memory performance in either low or
  high cue-target association conditions. However, participants' subjective assessments
  of their own cognitive fatigue correlated significantly with their prospective memory
  performance, regardless of the association between cues and target responses.
