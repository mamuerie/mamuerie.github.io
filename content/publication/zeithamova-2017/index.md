abstract: 'Pattern-information approaches to fMRI data analysis are becoming increasingly
  popular but few studies to date have investigated experimental design optimization
  for these analyses. Here, we tested several designs that varied in the number of
  trials and trial timing within fixed duration scans while participants encoded images
  of animals and tools. Trial timing conditions with fixed onset-to-onset timing ranged
  from slow 12-s trials with two repetitions of each item to quick 6-s trials with
  four repetitions per item. We also tested a jittered version of the quick design
  with 4-8s trials. We assessed the effect of trial timing on three dependent measures:
  category-level (animals vs. tools) decoding accuracy using a multivoxel pattern
  analysis, item-level (e.g., cat vs. dog vs. lion) information estimates using pattern
  similarity analysis, and memory effects comparing pattern similarity scores across
  repetitions of individual items subsequently remembered vs. forgotten. For single
  trial estimates, category decoding was equal across all trial timing conditions
  while item-level information and memory effects were better detected using slow
  trial timing. When modeling events on an item-by-item basis across all repetitions
  of a given item, a larger number of quick, regularly spaced trials provided an advantage
  over fewer slow trials for category decoding while item-level information was comparable
  across conditions. Jittered and non-jittered versions of the quick trial timing
  did not differ significantly in any analysis. These results will help inform experimental
  design choices in future studies planning to employ pattern-information analyses
  and demonstrate that design optimization guidelines developed for univariate analyses
  of a few conditions are not necessarily optimal for pattern-information analyses
  and condition-rich designs.'
