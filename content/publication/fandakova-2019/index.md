abstract: Successful memory encoding is supported by medial temporal, retrosplenial,
  and occipital regions, which show developmental differences in recruitment from
  childhood to adulthood. However, little is known about the extent to which neural
  specificity in these brain regions, or the distinctiveness with which sensory information
  is represented, continues to develop during middle childhood and how it contributes
  to memory performance. The present study used multivariate pattern analysis to examine
  the distinctiveness of different scene representations in 169 children and 31 adults,
  and its relation to memory performance. Most children provided data over up to three
  measurement occasions between 8 and 15 years (267 total scans), allowing us to examine
  changes in memory and neural specificity over time. Memory performance was lower
  in children than in adults, and increased in children over time. Different scenes
  presented during memory encoding could be reliably decoded from parahippocampal,
  lateral occipital, and retrosplenial regions in children and adults. Neural specificity
  in children was similar to adults, and did not change reliably over time. Among
  children, higher neural specificity in scene-processing regions was associated with
  better memory concurrently. These results suggest that the distinctiveness with
  which incoming information is represented is important for memory performance in
  childhood, but other processes operating on these representations support developmental
  improvements in memory performance over time.
