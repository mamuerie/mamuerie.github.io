abstract: Preprocessing of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) involves numerous
  steps to clean and standardize the data before statistical analysis. Generally,
  researchers create ad hoc preprocessing workflows for each dataset, building upon
  a large inventory of available tools. The complexity of these workflows has snowballed
  with rapid advances in acquisition and processing. We introduce fMRIPrep, an analysis-agnostic
  tool that addresses the challenge of robust and reproducible preprocessing for fMRI
  data. fMRIPrep automatically adapts a best-in-breed workflow to the idiosyncrasies
  of virtually any dataset, ensuring high-quality preprocessing without manual intervention.
  By introducing visual assessment checkpoints into an iterative integration framework
  for software testing, we show that fMRIPrep robustly produces high-quality results
  on a diverse fMRI data collection. Additionally, fMRIPrep introduces less uncontrolled
  spatial smoothness than observed with commonly used preprocessing tools. fMRIPrep
  equips neuroscientists with an easy-to-use and transparent preprocessing workflow,
  which can help ensure the validity of inference and the interpretability of results.
