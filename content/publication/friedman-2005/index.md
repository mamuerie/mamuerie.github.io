abstract: This study compared four common methods for scoring a popular working memory
  span task, Daneman and Carpenterâ€™s (1980) reading span test. More continuous measures,
  such as the total number of words recalled or the proportion of words per set averaged
  across all sets, were more normally distributed, had higher reliability, and had
  higher correlations with criterion measures (reading comprehension and Verbal SAT)
  than did traditional span scores that quantified the highest set size completed
  or the number of words in correct sets. Furthermore, creation of arbitrary groups
  (e.g., high-span and low-span groups) led to poor reliability and greatly reduced
  predictive power. It is recommended that researchers score span tasks with continuous
  measures and avoid post hoc dichotomization of working memory span groups.
