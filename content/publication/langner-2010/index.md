abstract: Performance decrements attributed to mental fatigue have been found to be
  especially pronounced in tasks that involve the voluntary control of attention.
  Here we explored whether mental fatigue from prolonged time on task (TOT) also impairs
  temporal preparation for speeded action in a simple reaction-time task. Temporal
  preparation is enabled by a warning signal presented before the imperative stimulus
  and usually results in shorter reaction time (RT). When the delay between warning
  and imperative stimuli - the foreperiod (FP) - varies between trials, responses
  are faster with longer FPs. This pattern has been proposed to arise from either
  voluntary attentional processes (temporal orienting) or automatic trial-to-trial
  learning (trace conditioning). The former account suggests a selective RT increase
  on long-FP trials with fatigue; the latter account suggests no such change. Over
  a work period of 51 min, we found the typical increase in overall RT but no selective
  RT increase after long FPs. This additivity indicates that TOT-induced mental fatigue
  generally reduces cognitive efficiency but leaves temporal preparation under time
  uncertainty unaffected. We consider this result more consistent with the trace-conditioning
  account of temporal preparation.
