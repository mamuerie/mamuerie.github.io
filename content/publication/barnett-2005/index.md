abstract: BACKGROUND Regression to the mean (RTM) is a statistical phenomenon that
  can make natural variation in repeated data look like real change. It happens when
  unusually large or small measurements tend to be followed by measurements that are
  closer to the mean. METHODS We give some examples of the phenomenon, and discuss
  methods to overcome it at the design and analysis stages of a study. RESULTS The
  effect of RTM in a sample becomes more noticeable with increasing measurement error
  and when follow-up measurements are only examined on a sub-sample selected using
  a baseline value. CONCLUSIONS RTM is a ubiquitous phenomenon in repeated data and
  should always be considered as a possible cause of an observed change. Its effect
  can be alleviated through better study design and use of suitable statistical methods.
