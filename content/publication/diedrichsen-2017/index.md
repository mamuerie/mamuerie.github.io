abstract: 'Representational models specify how activity patterns in populations of
  neurons (or, more generally, in multivariate brain-activity measurements) relate
  to sensory stimuli, motor responses, or cognitive processes. In an experimental
  context, representational models can be defined as hypotheses about the distribution
  of activity profiles across experimental conditions. Currently, three different
  methods are being used to test such hypotheses: encoding analysis, pattern component
  modeling (PCM), and representational similarity analysis (RSA). Here we develop
  a common mathematical framework for understanding the relationship of these three
  methods, which share one core commonality: all three evaluate the second moment
  of the distribution of activity profiles, which determines the representational
  geometry, and thus how well any feature can be decoded from population activity.
  Using simulated data for three different experimental designs, we compare the power
  of the methods to adjudicate between competing representational models. PCM implements
  a likelihood-ratio test and therefore provides the most powerful test if its assumptions
  hold. However, the other two approaches-when conducted appropriately-can perform
  similarly. In encoding analysis, the linear model needs to be appropriately regularized,
  which effectively imposes a prior on the activity profiles. With such a prior, an
  encoding model specifies a well-defined distribution of activity profiles. In RSA,
  the unequal variances and statistical dependencies of the dissimilarity estimates
  need to be taken into account to reach near-optimal power in inference. The three
  methods render different aspects of the information explicit (e.g. single-response
  tuning in encoding analysis and population-response representational dissimilarity
  in RSA) and have specific advantages in terms of computational demands, ease of
  use, and extensibility. The three methods are properly construed as complementary
  components of a single data-analytical toolkit for understanding neural representations
  on the basis of multivariate brain-activity data.'
