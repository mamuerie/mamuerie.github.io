abstract: 'This study aimed to explore the combined influence of age and cognitive
  control on the behavioural and electrophysiological indicators of local, restart
  and mixing costs. Two groups of middle-aged (49-60 y.o., N=40) and older (61-80
  y.o., N=40) adults were split according to their overall z-score in a composite
  of six neuropsychological measures of executive function. All participants performed
  a task-cueing version of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) adapted for measuring
  event-related potentials, whereby tonal cues instructed to switch or repeat the
  task rule. A single-task condition with identical sensory and motor response demands
  was used to aid interpretation of behavioural and brain responses to cues and target
  events. Working memory updating of stimulus-response mappings, as putatively indexed
  by local switch costs and cue-locked P3 activity (350-460 msec post-cue onset),
  was preserved in both older and low control adults. In turn, low control adults
  showed larger restart costs and enhanced cue-locked P2 amplitudes (190-250 msec)
  in the task-switching condition only, suggesting lesser preparatory control in the
  presence of interference. Low control adults showed comparatively larger mixing
  costs and smaller cue-locked fronto-central slow negativities (500-700 msec), suggesting
  an inefficient online maintenance of task-set information over time. In contrast,
  target-locked brain responses were mostly sensitive to age-related effects, with
  older adults showing two well-known effects: (1) an \"anterior shift\" in target
  P3 activity (350-460 msec), and (2) an attenuation of fronto-central slow negativities
  in single-task and task-switching conditions, respectively. The additive association
  found between age and cognitive control for different behavioural indexes of task-switch
  costs suggests a differential influence of these factors upon two successive information
  processing stages: individual differences in cognitive control mainly influenced
  the neural indexes of preparatory task-set activation and maintenance, whereas age-related
  effects influenced the neural indexes of target response selection and task execution.'
