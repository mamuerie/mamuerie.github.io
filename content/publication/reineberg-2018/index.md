abstract: "The brain is organized into a number of large networks based on shared
  function, for example, high-level cognitive functions (frontoparietal network),
  attentional capabilities (dorsal and ventral attention networks), and internal mentation
  (default network). The correlations of these networks during resting-state fMRI
  scans varies across individuals and is an indicator of individual differences in
  ability. Prior work shows higher cognitive functioning (as measured by working memory
  and attention tasks) is associated with stronger negative correlations between frontoparietal/attention
  and default networks, suggesting that increased ability may depend upon the diverging
  activation of networks with contrasting function. However, these prior studies lack
  specificity with regard to the higher-level cognitive functions involved, particularly
  with regards to separable components of executive function (EF). Here we decompose
  EF into three factors from the unity/diversity model of EFs: Common EF, Shifting-specific
  EF, and Updating-specific EF, measuring each via factor scores derived from a battery
  of behavioral tasks completed by 250 adult participants (age 28) at the time of
  a resting-state scan. We found the hypothesized segregated pattern only for Shifting-specific
  EF. Specifically, after accounting for one's general EF ability (Common EF), individuals
  better able to fluidly switch between task sets have a stronger negative correlation
  between the ventral attention network and the default network. We also report non-predicted
  novel findings in that individuals with higher Shifting-specific abilities exhibited
  more positive connectivity between frontoparietal and visual networks, while those
  individuals with higher Common EF exhibited increased connectivity between sensory
  and default networks. Overall, these results reveal a new degree of specificity
  with regard to connectivity/EF relationships."
