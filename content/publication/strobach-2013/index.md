abstract: Schumacher et al. Psychological Science 12:101-108, (2001) demonstrated
  the elimination of most dual-task costs (\"perfect time-sharing\") after extensive
  dual-task practice of a visual and an auditory task in combination. For the present
  research, we used a transfer methodology to examine this practice effect in more
  detail, asking what task-processing stages were sped up by this dual-task practice.
  Such research will be essential to specify mechanisms associated with the practice-related
  elimination of dual-task costs. In three experiments, we introduced postpractice
  transfer probes focusing on the perception, central response-selection, and final
  motor-response stages. The results indicated that the major change achieved by dual-task
  practice was a speed-up in the central response-selection stages of both tasks.
  Additionally, perceptual-stage shortening of the auditory task was found to contribute
  to the improvements in time-sharing. For a better understanding of such time-sharing,
  we discuss the contributions of the present findings in relation to models of practiced
  dual-task performance.
