abstract: Multi-tasking is a familiar situation where behavioral performance is often
  challenged. To date, fMRI studies investigating the neural underpinning of dual-task
  interference have mostly relied on local brain activation maps or static brain connectivity
  networks. Here, based on task fMRI we explored how fluctuations in behavior during
  concurrent performance of a visuospatial and a speech task relate to alternations
  in the topology of dynamic brain connectivity networks. We combined a time-resolved
  functional connectivity and complex network analysis with a sliding window approach
  applied to the trial by trial behavioral responses to investigate the coupling between
  dynamic brain networks and dual-task behavior at close temporal proximity. Participants
  showed fluctuations in their dual-task behavior over time, with the accuracy in
  the component tasks being statistically independent from one another. On the global
  level of brain networks we found that dynamic changes of network topology were differentially
  coupled with the behavior in each component task during the course of dual-tasking.
  While momentary decrease in the global efficiency of dynamic brain networks correlated
  with subsequent increase in visuospatial accuracy, better speech performance was
  preceded by higher global network efficiency and was followed by an increase in
  between-module connectivity over time. Additionally, dynamic alternations in the
  modular organization of brain networks at the posterior cingulate cortex were differentially
  predictive for the visuospatial as compared to the speech accuracy over time. Our
  results provide the first evidence that, during the course of dual-tasking, each
  component task is supported by a distinct topological configuration of brain connectivity
  networks. This finding suggests that the failure of functional brain connectivity
  networks to adapt to an optimal topology supporting the performance in both component
  tasks at the same time contributes to the moment to moment fluctuations in dual-task
  behavior.
