abstract: A paper by Grinband et al. (this issue) argues that dorsal medial prefrontal
  cortex (mPFC) activity reflects time-on-task rather than conflict or error likelihood.
  In this commentary, Brown suggests that the findings are consistent with a new model
  in which mPFC learns to predict the nature and timing of action outcomes. The new
  model predicts that time-on-task effects coexist with distinct error likelihood
  effects, a result which is consistent with other recent findings from fMRI and monkey
  neurophysiology.
