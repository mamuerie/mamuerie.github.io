abstract: 'Previous evidence suggests that relatively separate neural networks underlie
  initial learning of rule-based and information-integration categorization tasks.
  With the development of automaticity, categorization behavior in both tasks becomes
  increasingly similar and exclusively related to activity in cortical regions. The
  present study uses multi-voxel pattern analysis to directly compare the development
  of automaticity in different categorization tasks. Each of the three groups of participants
  received extensive training in a different categorization task: either an information-integration
  task, or one of two rule-based tasks. Four training sessions were performed inside
  an MRI scanner. Three different analyses were performed on the imaging data from
  a number of regions of interest (ROIs). The common patterns analysis had the goal
  of revealing ROIs with similar patterns of activation across tasks. The unique patterns
  analysis had the goal of revealing ROIs with dissimilar patterns of activation across
  tasks. The representational similarity analysis aimed at exploring (1) the similarity
  of category representations across ROIs and (2) how those patterns of similarities
  compared across tasks. The results showed that common patterns of activation were
  present in motor areas and basal ganglia early in training, but only in the former
  later on. Unique patterns were found in a variety of cortical and subcortical areas
  early in training, but they were dramatically reduced with training. Finally, patterns
  of representational similarity between brain regions became increasingly similar
  across tasks with the development of automaticity.'
