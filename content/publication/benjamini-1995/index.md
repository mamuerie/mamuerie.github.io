abstract: '[The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling
  the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point
  out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is
  presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected
  hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when
  all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the
  control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there
  is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure
  is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and
  a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new
  procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.]'
