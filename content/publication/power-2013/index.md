abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience is how the human brain
  self-organizes to perform tasks. Multiple accounts of this self-organization are
  currently influential and in this article we survey one of these accounts. We begin
  by introducing a psychological model of task control and several neuroimaging signals
  it predicts. We then discuss where such signals are found across tasks with emphasis
  on brain regions where multiple control signals are present. We then present results
  derived from spontaneous task-free functional connectivity between control-related
  regions that dovetail with distinctions made by control signals present in these
  regions, leading to a proposal that there are at least two task control systems
  in the brain. This prompts consideration of whether and how such control systems
  distinguish themselves from other brain regions in a whole-brain context. We present
  evidence from whole-brain networks that such distinctions do occur and that control
  systems comprise some of the basic system-level organizational elements of the human
  brain. We close with observations from the whole-brain networks that may suggest
  parsimony between multiple accounts of cognitive control.
