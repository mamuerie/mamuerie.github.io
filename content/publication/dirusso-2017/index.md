abstract: Research on preparatory brain processes taking place before acting shows
  unexpected connections with cognitive processing. From 50 years, we know that motor-related
  brain activity can be measured by electrocortical recordings 1-3s before voluntary
  actions. This readiness potential has been associated with increasing excitably
  of premotor and motor areas and directly linked to the kinematic of the upcoming
  action. Now we know that the mere motor preparation is only one function of a more
  complex preparatory activity. Recent research shows that before any action many
  cognitive processes may occur depending on various aspects of the action, such as
  complexity, meaning, emotional valence, fatigue and consequences of the action itself.
  In addition to studies on self-paced action, the review considers also studies on
  externally-triggered paradigms showing differences in preparation processes related
  to age, physical exercise, and task instructions. Evidences from electrophysiological
  and neuroimaging recording indicate that in addition to the motor areas, the prefrontal,
  parietal and sensory cortices may be active during action preparation to anticipate
  future events and calibrate responses.
