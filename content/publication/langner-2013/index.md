abstract: Maintaining attention for more than a few seconds is essential for mastering
  everyday life. Yet, our ability to stay focused on a particular task is limited,
  resulting in well-known performance decrements with increasing time on task. Intriguingly,
  such decrements are even more likely if the task is cognitively simple and repetitive.
  The attentional function that enables our prolonged engagement in intellectually
  unchallenging, uninteresting activities has been termed vigilant attention. Here
  we synthesized what we have learned from functional neuroimaging about the mechanisms
  of this essential mental faculty. To this end, a quantitative meta-analysis of pertinent
  neuroimaging studies was performed, including supplementary analyses of moderating
  factors. Furthermore, we reviewed the available evidence on neural time-on-task
  effects, additionally considering information obtained from patients with focal
  brain damage. Integrating the results of both meta-analysis and review, we identified
  a set of mainly right-lateralized brain regions that may form the core network subserving
  vigilant attention in humans, including dorsomedial, mid- and ventrolateral prefrontal
  cortex, anterior insula, parietal areas (intraparietal sulcus, temporoparietal junction),
  and subcortical structures (cerebellar vermis, thalamus, putamen, midbrain). We
  discuss the potential functional roles of different nodes of this network as well
  as implications of our findings for a theoretical account of vigilant attention.
  It is conjectured that sustaining attention is a multicomponent, nonunitary mental
  faculty, involving a mixture of (a) sustained/recurrent processes subserving task-set/arousal
  maintenance and (b) transient processes subserving the target-driven reorienting
  of attention. Finally, limitations of previous studies are considered and suggestions
  for future research are provided.
