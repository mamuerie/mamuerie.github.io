abstract: 'The genetic relationship between lower (information processing speed),
  intermediate (working memory), and higher levels (complex cognitive processes as
  indexed by IQ) of mental ability was studied in a classical twin design comprising
  166 monozygotic and 190 dizygotic twin pairs. Processing speed was measured by a
  choice reaction time (RT) task (2-, 4-, and 8-choice), working memory by a visual-spatial
  delayed response task, and IQ by the Multidimensional Aptitude Battery. Multivariate
  analysis, adjusted for test-retest reliability, showed the presence of a genetic
  factor influencing all variables and a genetic factor influencing 4- and 8-choice
  RTs, working memory, and IQ. There were also genetic factors specific to 8-choice
  RT, working memory, and IQ. The results confirmed a strong relationship between
  choice RT and IQ (phenotypic correlations: -0.31 to -0.53 in females, -0.32 to -0.56
  in males; genotypic correlations: -0.45 to -0.70) and a weaker but significant association
  between working memory and IQ (phenotypic: 0.26 in females, 0.13 in males; genotypic:
  0.34). A significant part of the genetic variance (43%) in IQ was not related to
  either choice RT or delayed response performance, and may represent higher order
  cognitive processes.'
