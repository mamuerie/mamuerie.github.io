abstract: Self-suppression refers to the phenomenon that sensations initiated by our
  own movements are typically less salient, and elicit an attenuated neural response,
  compared to sensations resulting from changes in the external world. Evidence for
  self-suppression is provided by previous ERP studies in the auditory modality, which
  have found that healthy participants typically exhibit a reduced auditory N1 component
  when auditory stimuli are self-initiated as opposed to externally initiated. However,
  the literature investigating self-suppression in the visual modality is sparse,
  with mixed findings and experimental protocols. An EEG study was conducted to expand
  our understanding of self-suppression across different sensory modalities. Healthy
  participants experienced either an auditory (tone) or visual (pattern-reversal)
  stimulus following a willed button press (self-initiated), a random interval (externally
  initiated, unpredictable onset), or a visual countdown (externally initiated, predictable
  onset-to match the intrinsic predictability of self-initiated stimuli), while EEG
  was continuously recorded. Reduced N1 amplitudes for self- versus externally initiated
  tones indicated that self-suppression occurred in the auditory domain. In contrast,
  the visual N145 component was amplified for self- versus externally initiated pattern
  reversals. Externally initiated conditions did not differ as a function of their
  predictability. These findings highlight a difference in sensory processing of self-initiated
  stimuli across modalities, and may have implications for clinical disorders that
  are ostensibly associated with abnormal self-suppression.
