abstract: The brain is a dynamic, flexible network that continuously reconfigures.
  However, the neural underpinnings of how state-dependent variability of dynamic
  functional connectivity (vdFC) relates to cognitive flexibility are unclear. We
  therefore investigated flexible functional connectivity during resting-state and
  task-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI and t-fMRI, resp.) and
  performed separate, out-of-scanner neuropsychological testing. We hypothesize that
  state-dependent vdFC between the frontoparietal network (FPN) and the default mode
  network (DMN) relates to cognitive flexibility. Seventeen healthy subjects performed
  the Stroop color word test and underwent t-fMRI (Stroop computerized version) and
  rs-fMRI. Time series were extracted from a cortical atlas, and a sliding window
  approach was used to obtain a number of correlation matrices per subject. vdFC was
  defined as the standard deviation of connectivity strengths over these windows.
  Higher task-state FPN-DMN vdFC was associated with greater out-of-scanner cognitive
  flexibility, while the opposite relationship was present for resting-state FPN-DMN
  vdFC. Moreover, greater contrast between task-state and resting-state vdFC related
  to better cognitive performance. In conclusion, our results suggest that not only
  the dynamics of connectivity between these networks is seminal for optimal functioning,
  but also that the contrast between dynamics across states reflects cognitive performance.
