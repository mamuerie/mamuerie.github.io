abstract: Increased demands on cognitive control trigger changes in processing mode.
  One such modulation involves a shift from parallel to serial processing. This study
  assessed the role of control demand in determining whether dual-task processing
  is performed serially or in parallel. We used two critical indices, based on the
  response-selection bottleneck model, to show that response selection was serial
  when a task switch was involved, but partly parallel when the simultaneous performance
  of the tasks did not involve task switching.
