abstract: "It is commonly assumed that functional brain connectivity reflects structural
  brain connectivity. The exact relationship between structure and function, however,
  might not be straightforward. In this review we aim to examine how our understanding
  of the relationship between structure and function in the 'resting' brain has advanced
  over the last several years. We discuss eight articles that directly compare resting-state
  functional connectivity with structural connectivity and three clinical case studies
  of patients with limited white matter connections between the cerebral hemispheres.
  All studies examined show largely convergent results: the strength of resting-state
  functional connectivity is positively correlated with structural connectivity strength.
  However, functional connectivity is also observed between regions where there is
  little or no structural connectivity, which most likely indicates functional correlations
  mediated by indirect structural connections (i.e. via a third region). As the methodologies
  for measuring structural and functional connectivity continue to improve and their
  complementary strengths are applied in parallel, we can expect important advances
  in our diagnostic and prognostic capacities in diseases like Alzheimer's, multiple
  sclerosis, and stroke."
