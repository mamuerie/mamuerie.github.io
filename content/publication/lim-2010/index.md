abstract: During sustained periods of a taxing cognitive workload, humans typically
  display time-on-task (TOT) effects, in which performance gets steadily worse over
  the period of task engagement. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used in this study to investigate the neural
  correlates of TOT effects in a group of 15 subjects as they performed a 20-min continuous
  psychomotor vigilance test (PVT). Subjects displayed significant TOT effects, as
  seen in progressively slower reaction times and significantly increased mental fatigue
  ratings after the task. Perfusion data showed that the PVT activates a right lateralized
  fronto-parietal attentional network in addition to the basal ganglia and sensorimotor
  cortices. The fronto-parietal network was less active during post-task rest compared
  to pre-task rest, and regional CBF decrease in this network correlated with performance
  decline. These results demonstrate the persistent effects of cognitive fatigue in
  the fronto-parietal network after a period of heavy mental work and indicate the
  critical role of this attentional network in mediating TOT effects. Furthermore,
  resting regional CBF in the thalamus and right middle frontal gyrus prior to task
  onset was predictive of subjects' subsequent performance decline, suggesting that
  resting CBF quantified by ASL perfusion fMRI may be a useful indicator of performance
  potential and a marker of the level of fatigue in the neural attentional system.
