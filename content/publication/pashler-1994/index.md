abstract: People often have trouble performing 2 relatively simple tasks concurrently.
  The causes of this interference and its implications for the nature of attentional
  limitations have been controversial for 40 years, but recent experimental findings
  are beginning to provide some answers. Studies of the psychological refractory period
  effect indicate a stubborn bottleneck encompassing the process of choosing actions
  and probably memory retrieval generally, together with certain other cognitive operations.
  Other limitations associated with task preparation, sensory-perceptual processes,
  and timing can generate additional and distinct forms of interference. These conclusions
  challenge widely accepted ideas about attentional resources and probe reaction time
  methodologies. They also suggest new ways of thinking about continuous dual-task
  performance, effects of extraneous stimulation (e.g., stop signals), and automaticity.
  Implications for higher mental processes are discussed.
