abstract: 'Introduction -- Image processing basics -- Preprocessing fMRI data -- Spatial
  normalization -- Statistical modeling: single subject analysis -- Statistical modeling:

  -- Multivoxel pattern analysis and machine learning -- Visualizing, localizing,
  and reporting fMRI data -- Review of general linear model -- Data organization and

  become the most popular method for imaging brain function. Handbook of Functional
  MRI Data Analysis provides a comprehensive and practical introduction to the methods
  used for fMRI data analysis. Using minimal jargon, this book explains the concepts
  behind processing fMRI data, focusing on the techniques that are most commonly used
  in the field. This book provides background about the methods employed by common
  data analysis packages including FSL, SPM and AFNI. Some of the newest cutting-edge
  techniques, including pattern classification analysis, connectivity modeling and
  resting state network analysis, are also discussed. Readers of this book, whether
  newcomers to the field or experienced researchers, will obtain a deep and effective
  knowledge of how to employ fMRI analysis to ask scientific questions and become
  more sophisticated users of fMRI analysis software'
