abstract: Intelligence describes the general cognitive ability level of a person.
  It is one of the most fundamental concepts in psychological science and is crucial
  for the effective adaption of behavior to varying environmental demands. Changing
  external task demands have been shown to induce reconfiguration of functional brain
  networks. However, whether neural reconfiguration between different tasks is associated
  with intelligence has not yet been investigated. We used functional magnetic resonance
  imaging data from 812 subjects to show that higher scores of general intelligence
  are related to less brain network reconfiguration between resting state and seven
  different task states as well as to network reconfiguration between tasks. This
  association holds for all functional brain networks except the motor system and
  replicates in two independent samples (n = 138 and n = 184). Our findings suggest
  that the intrinsic network architecture of individuals with higher intelligence
  scores is closer to the network architecture as required by various cognitive demands.
  Multitask brain network reconfiguration may, therefore, represent a neural reflection
  of the behavioral positive manifold - the essence of the concept of general intelligence.
  Finally, our results support neural efficiency theories of cognitive ability and
  reveal insights into human intelligence as an emergent property from a distributed
  multitask brain network.
