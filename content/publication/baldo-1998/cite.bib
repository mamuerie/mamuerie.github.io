 abstract = {The results from this experiment supported the hypothesis that Stroop-like interference effects are generated by both arrow and word distractors, but that the amount of interference depends on the response modality. Specifically, the RTs in manual conditions were particularly slowed by arrow distractors. Conversely, the RTs in vocal conditions were particularly slowed by word distractors. These findings suggest a compatibility effect for arrows in manual responses and a similar effect for words in vocal responses.},
