abstract: The results from this experiment supported the hypothesis that Stroop-like
  interference effects are generated by both arrow and word distractors, but that
  the amount of interference depends on the response modality. Specifically, the RTs
  in manual conditions were particularly slowed by arrow distractors. Conversely,
  the RTs in vocal conditions were particularly slowed by word distractors. These
  findings suggest a compatibility effect for arrows in manual responses and a similar
  effect for words in vocal responses.
