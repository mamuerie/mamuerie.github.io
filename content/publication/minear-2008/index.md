abstract: Performance on task switching, a paradigm commonly used to measure executive
  function, has been shown to improve with practice. However, no study has tested
  whether these benefits are specific to the tasks learned or are transferable to
  new situations. We report evidence of transferable improvement in a cued, randomly
  switching paradigm as measured by mixing cost, but we report no consistent improvement
  for switch cost. Improvement in mixing costs arises from a relative reduction in
  time to perform both switch and nonswitch trials that immediately follow switch
  trials, implicating the ability to recover from unexpected switches as the source
  of improvement. These results add to a growing number of studies demonstrating generalizable
  improvement with training on executive processing.
