abstract: "Much recent research suggests that willpower--the capacity to exert self-control--is
  a limited resource that is depleted after exertion. We propose that whether depletion
  takes place or not depends on a person's belief about whether willpower is a limited
  resource. Study 1 found that individual differences in lay theories about willpower
  moderate ego-depletion effects: People who viewed the capacity for self-control
  as not limited did not show diminished self-control after a depleting experience.
  Study 2 replicated the effect, manipulating lay theories about willpower. Study
  3 addressed questions about the mechanism underlying the effect. Study 4, a longitudinal
  field study, found that theories about willpower predict change in eating behavior,
  procrastination, and self-regulated goal striving in depleting circumstances. Taken
  together, the findings suggest that reduced self-control after a depleting task
  or during demanding periods may reflect people's beliefs about the availability
  of willpower rather than true resource depletion."
