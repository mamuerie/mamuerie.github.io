abstract: 'Network neuroscience provides tools that can easily be used to verify main
  assumptions of the global workspace theory (GWT), such as the existence of highly
  segregated information processing during effortless tasks performance, engagement
  of multiple distributed networks during effortful tasks and the critical role of
  long-range connections in workspace formation. A number of studies support the assumptions
  of GWT by showing the reorganization of the whole-brain functional network during
  cognitive task performance; however, the involvement of specific large scale networks
  in the formation of workspace is still not well-understood. The aims of our study
  were: (1) to examine changes in the whole-brain functional network under increased
  cognitive demands of working memory during an n-back task, and their relationship
  with behavioral outcomes; and (2) to provide a comprehensive description of local
  changes that may be involved in the formation of the global workspace, using hub
  detection and network-based statistic. Our results show that network modularity
  decreased with increasing cognitive demands, and this change allowed us to predict
  behavioral performance. The number of connector hubs increased, whereas the number
  of provincial hubs decreased when the task became more demanding. We also found
  that the default mode network (DMN) increased its connectivity to other networks
  while decreasing connectivity between its own regions. These results, apart from
  replicating previous findings, provide a valuable insight into the mechanisms of
  the formation of the global workspace, highlighting the role of the DMN in the processes
  of network integration. Hum Brain Mapp 38:3659–3674, 2017. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals,
