abstract: Complex span tasks, assumed by many to measure an individual's working memory
  capacity, are predictive of several aspects of higher-order cognition. However,
  the underlying cause of the relationships between \"processing-and-storage\" tasks
  and cognitive abilities is still hotly debated nearly 30 years after the tasks were
  first introduced. The current study utilised latent constructs across verbal, numerical,
  and spatial content domains to examine a number of questions regarding the predictive
  power of complex span tasks. In particular, the relations among processing time,
  processing accuracy, and storage accuracy from the complex span tasks were examined,
  in combination with their respective relationships with fluid intelligence. The
  results point to a complicated pattern of unique and shared variance among the constructs.
  Implications for various theories of working memory are discussed.
