abstract: The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has consistently been implicated
  in cognitive control of motor behavior. There is, however, considerable variability
  in the exact location and extension of these activations across functional magnetic
  resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments. This poses the question of whether this variability
  reflects sampling error and spatial uncertainty in fMRI experiments or structural
  and functional heterogeneity of this region. This study shows that the right DLPFC
  as observed in 4 different experiments tapping executive action control may be subdivided
  into 2 distinct subregions-an anterior-ventral and a posterior-dorsal one - based
  on their whole-brain co-activation patterns across neuroimaging studies. Investigation
  of task-dependent and task-independent connectivity revealed both clusters to be
  involved in distinct neural networks. The posterior subregion showed increased connectivity
  with bilateral intraparietal sulci, whereas the anterior subregion showed increased
  connectivity with the anterior cingulate cortex. Functional characterization with
  quantitative forward and reverse inferences revealed the anterior network to be
  more strongly associated with attention and action inhibition processes, whereas
  the posterior network was more strongly related to action execution and working
  memory. The present data provide evidence that cognitive action control in the right
  DLPFC may rely on differentiable neural networks and cognitive functions.
