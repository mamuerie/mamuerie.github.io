abstract: Healthy aging is associated with changes in cognitive performance including
  executive functions (EFs) and their associated brain activation patterns. However,
  it has remained unclear which EFrelated brain regions are affected consistently,
  because the results of pertinent neuroimaging studies and earlier meta-analyses
  vary considerably. We, therefore, conducted new rigorous meta-analyses of published
  age differences in EF-related brain activity. Out of a larger set of regions associated
  with EFs, only left inferior frontal junction (IFJ) and left anterior cuneus/precuneus
  (aC/PrC) were found to show consistent age differences. To further characterize
  these two agesensitive regions, we performed seed-based resting-state functional
  connectivity (RS-FC) analyses using fMRI data from a large adult sample with a wide
  age range. We also assessed associations of the two regions’ whole-brain RS-FC patterns
  with age and EF performance. Although functional profiling and RS-FC analyses point
  towards a domain-general role of left IFJ in EFs, the pattern of individual study
  contributions to the meta-analytic results suggests process-specific modulations
  by age. Our analyses further indicate that left aC/PrC is recruited differently
  by older (compared to younger) adults during EF tasks, potentially reflecting inefficiencies
  in switching the attentional focus. Overall, our findings question earlier meta-analytic
  results and suggest a larger heterogeneity of age-related differences in brain activity
  associated with EFs. Hence, they encourage future research that pays greater attention
  to replicability, investigates age-related differences in deactivation, and focuses
  on more narrowly defined EF subprocesses, combining multiple behavioral assessments
  with multi-modal imaging.
