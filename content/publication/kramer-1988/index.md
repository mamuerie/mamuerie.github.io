abstract: Previous research has found that properties of automatic processing do not
  always co-occur, suggesting that the acquisition rates may differ. The present study
  investigated the acquisition rate of several of these properties by employing additive
  factors logic, dual task methodology, and event-related brain potentials. Seven
  subjects participated in a ten session experiment in which they performed two tasks,
  a visual/memory search task and a pursuit step tracking task, both together and
  separately. RT and P300 latency measures indicated that parallel processing of the
  display was achieved early in training in the consistent mapping condition. This
  processing was unaffected by dual task demands. An analysis of RT/P300 ratios suggests
  that another form of perceptual efficiency was achieved later in practice in both
  the varied and consistently mapped search tasks. This effect was larger in the consistent
  mapping condition. Reductions in the slope of the memory set function occurred significantly
  earlier for P300 latency than for RT, suggesting that the stimulus evaluation processes
  became automated more rapidly than the response selection components of memory search.
  Consistent with an analysis of the processing demands of the two tasks, the introduction
  of the tracking task and an increase in tracking difficulty produced equivalent
  interference during consistent and varied mapping conditions. Results are discussed
  in terms of models of skill, skill acquisition and component task automaticity.
