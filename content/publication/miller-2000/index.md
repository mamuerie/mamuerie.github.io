abstract: One of the enduring mysteries of brain function concerns the process of
  cognitive control. How does complex and seemingly willful behaviour emerge from
  interactions between millions of neurons? This has long been suspected to depend
  on the prefrontal cortex--the neocortex at the anterior end of the brain--but now
  we are beginning to uncover its neural basis. Nearly all intended behaviour is learned
  and so depends on a cognitive system that can acquire and implement the 'rules of
  the game' needed to achieve a given goal in a given situation. Studies indicate
  that the prefrontal cortex is central in this process. It provides an infrastructure
  for synthesizing a diverse range of information that lays the foundation for the
  complex forms of behaviour observed in primates.
