abstract: Impaired dual-task performance in younger and older adults can be improved
  with practice. Optimal conditions even allow for a (near) elimination of this impairment
  in younger adults. However, practice effects under these conditions in older adults
  are unknown. Further, it is open, how changed task scheduling and/ or the acquisition
  of task coordination skills affect the temporal overlap of two tasks in different
  age groups; this overlap indicate the involvement of these practice-related mechanisms
  to compensate for impaired dual-task performance. In a dual-task situation of Schumacher
  et al. (2001 , Psychological Science, 12, 230) including optimal conditions for
  dual-task performance, both younger and older adults were able to achieve an improvement
  in dual-task performance with 8 practice sessions to the same degree. The temporal
  task overlap changed similarly in both age groups during these sessions demonstrating
  a similar degree of the involvement of compensation mechanisms in younger and older
  adults. At the end of practice, however, we showed that older adults do not achieve
  the same optimized dual-task performance level of younger adults.
