 abstract = {Impaired dual-task performance in younger and older adults can be improved with practice. Optimal conditions even allow for a (near) elimination of this impairment in younger adults. However, practice effects under these conditions in older adults are unknown. Further, it is open, how changed task scheduling and/ or the acquisition of task coordination skills affect the temporal overlap of two tasks in different age groups; this overlap indicate the involvement of these practice-related mechanisms to compensate for impaired dual-task performance. In a dual-task situation of Schumacher et al. (2001 , Psychological Science, 12, 230) including optimal conditions for dual-task performance, both younger and older adults were able to achieve an improvement in dual-task performance with 8 practice sessions to the same degree. The temporal task overlap changed similarly in both age groups during these sessions demonstrating a similar degree of the involvement of compensation mechanisms in younger and older adults. At the end of practice, however, we showed that older adults do not achieve the same optimized dual-task performance level of younger adults.},
