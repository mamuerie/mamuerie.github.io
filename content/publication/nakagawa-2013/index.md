abstract: Fatigue reflects the functioning of our physiological negative feedback
  system, which prevents us from overworking. When fatigued, however, we often try
  to suppress this system in an effort to compensate for the resulting deterioration
  in performance. Previous studies have suggested that the effect of fatigue on neurovascular
  demand may be influenced by this compensatory effort. The primary goal of the present
  study was to isolate the effect of compensatory effort on neurovascular demand.
  Healthy male volunteers participated in a series of visual and auditory divided
  attention tasks that steadily increased fatigue levels for 2 hours. Functional magnetic
  resonance imaging scans were performed during the first and last quarter of the
  study (Pre and Post sessions, respectively). Tasks with low and high attentional
  load (Low and High conditions, respectively) were administrated in alternating blocks.
  We assumed that compensatory effort would be greater under the High-attentional-load
  condition compared with the Low-load condition. The difference was assessed during
  the two sessions. The effect of compensatory effort on neurovascular demand was
  evaluated by examining the interaction between load (High vs. Low) and time (Pre
  vs. Post). Significant fatigue-induced deactivation (i.e., Pre$>$Post) was observed
  in the frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal cortices, in the cerebellum, and
  in the midbrain in both the High and Low conditions. The interaction was significantly
  greater in the High than in the Low condition in the midbrain. Neither significant
  fatigue-induced activation (i.e., Pre$<$Post), nor its interaction with factor Load,
  was identified. The observed midbrain deactivation ([PreH - PostH]$>$[PreE- PostE])
  may reflect suppression of the negative feedback system that normally triggers recuperative
  rest to maintain homeostasis.
