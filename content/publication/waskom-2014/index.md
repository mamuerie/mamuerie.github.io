abstract: Cognitive control allows stimulus-response processing to be aligned with
  internal goals and is thus central to intelligent, purposeful behavior. Control
  is thought to depend in part on the active representation of task information in
  prefrontal cortex (PFC), which provides a source of contextual bias on perception,
  decision making, and action. In the present study, we investigated the organization,
  influences, and consequences of context representation as human subjects performed
  a cued sorting task that required them to flexibly judge the relationship between
  pairs of multivalent stimuli. Using a connectivity-based parcellation of PFC and
  multivariate decoding analyses, we determined that context is specifically and transiently
  represented in a region spanning the inferior frontal sulcus during context-dependent
  decision making. We also found strong evidence that decision context is represented
  within the intraparietal sulcus, an area previously shown to be functionally networked
  with the inferior frontal sulcus at rest and during task performance. Rule-guided
  allocation of attention to different stimulus dimensions produced discriminable
  patterns of activation in visual cortex, providing a signature of top-down bias
  over perception. Furthermore, demands on cognitive control arising from the task
  structure modulated context representation, which was found to be strongest after
  a shift in task rules. When context representation in frontoparietal areas increased
  in strength, as measured by the discriminability of high-dimensional activation
  patterns, the bias on attended stimulus features was enhanced. These results provide
  novel evidence that illuminates the mechanisms by which humans flexibly guide behavior
  in complex environments.
