abstract: In this study we examined whether the effects of mental fatigue on behaviour
  are due to reduced action monitoring as indexed by the error related negativity
  (Ne/ERN), N2 and contingent negative variation (CNV) event-related potential (ERP)
  components. Therefore, we had subjects perform a task, which required a high degree
  of action monitoring, continuously for 2h. In addition we tried to relate the observed
  behavioural and electrophysiological changes to motivational processes and individual
  differences. Changes in task performance due to fatigue were accompanied by a decrease
  in Ne/ERN and N2 amplitude, reflecting impaired action monitoring, as well as a
  decrease in CNV amplitude which reflects reduced response preparation with increasing
  fatigue. Increasing the motivational level of our subjects resulted in changes in
  behaviour and brain activity that were different for individual subjects. Subjects
  that increased their performance accuracy displayed an increase in Ne/ERN amplitude,
  while subjects that increased their response speed displayed an increase in CNV
  amplitude. We will discuss the effects prolonged task performance on the behavioural
  and physiological indices of action monitoring, as well as the relationship between
  fatigue, motivation and individual differences.
