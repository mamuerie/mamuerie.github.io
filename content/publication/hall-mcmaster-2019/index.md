abstract: Cognitive flexibility is critical for intelligent behavior. However, its
  execution is effortful and often suboptimal. Recent work indicates that flexible
  behavior can be improved by the prospect of reward, which suggests that rewards
  optimize flexible control processes. Here we investigated how different reward prospects
  influence neural encoding of task rule information to optimize cognitive flexibility.
  We applied representational similarity analysis to human electroencephalograms,
  recorded while female and male participants performed a rule-guided decision-making
  task. During the task, the prospect of reward varied from trial to trial. Participants
  made faster, more accurate judgements on high-reward trials. Critically, high reward
  boosted neural coding of the active task rule, and the extent of this increase was
  associated with improvements in task performance. Additionally, the effect of high
  reward on task rule coding was most pronounced on switch trials, where rules were
  updated relative to the previous trial. These results suggest that reward prospect
  can promote cognitive performance by strengthening neural coding of task rule information,
  helping to improve cognitive flexibility during complex behavior.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
  The importance of motivation is evident in the ubiquity with which reward prospect
  guides adaptive behavior and the striking number of neurological conditions associated
  with motivational impairments. In this study, we investigated how dynamic changes
  in motivation, as manipulated through reward, shape neural coding for task rules
  during a flexible decision-making task. The results of this work suggest that motivation
  to obtain reward modulates the encoding of task rules needed for flexible behavior.
  The extent to which reward increased task rule coding also tracked improvements
  in behavioral performance under high-reward conditions. These findings help to inform
  how motivation shapes neural processing in the healthy human brain.
