abstract: This book presents a multidisciplinary approach to the study of relationships
  between perception and action. It reflects the renewed interest in problems of action
  control that has emerged in psychology during the last decade and created a new
  theoretical climate bringing psychology closer to the biological sciences. Each
  chapter presents both a particular point of view and a comprehensive overview of
  recent findings relevant to the author's approach
