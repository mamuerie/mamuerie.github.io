 abstract = {This book presents a multidisciplinary approach to the study of relationships between perception and action. It reflects the renewed interest in problems of action control that has emerged in psychology during the last decade and created a new theoretical climate bringing psychology closer to the biological sciences. Each chapter presents both a particular point of view and a comprehensive overview of recent findings relevant to the author's approach},
