abstract: 'Standard neuroimaging data analysis based on traditional principles of
  experimental design, modelling, and statistical inference is increasingly complemented
  by novel analysis methods, driven e.g. by machine learning methods. While these
  novel approaches provide new insights into neuroimaging data, they often have unexpected
  properties, generating a growing literature on possible pitfalls. We propose to
  meet this challenge by adopting a habit of systematic testing of experimental design,
  analysis procedures, and statistical inference. Specifically, we suggest to apply
  the analysis method used for experimental data also to aspects of the experimental
  design, simulated confounds, simulated null data, and control data. We stress the
  importance of keeping the analysis method the same in main and test analyses, because
  only this way possible confounds and unexpected properties can be reliably detected
  and avoided. We describe and discuss this Same Analysis Approach in detail, and
  demonstrate it in two worked examples using multivariate decoding. With these examples,
  we reveal two sources of error: A mismatch between counterbalancing (crossover designs)
  and cross-validation which leads to systematic below-chance accuracies, and linear
  decoding of a nonlinear effect, a difference in variance.'
