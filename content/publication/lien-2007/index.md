abstract: 'The present dual-task study used lateralized readiness potentials (LRPs)
  and behavioral measures to determine whether response activation for Task 1 and
  Task 2 can occur in parallel. We also examined whether task similarity (known as
  dimensional overlap) increases parallel central processing by making it difficult
  to selectively activate one task set. With dimensional overlap, the behavioral data
  replicated previous findings of backward correspondence effects: The Task 1 response
  was influenced by its compatibility with the Task 2 response. This finding suggests
  parallel response activation. The LRP data supported this conclusion: Task 2 response
  activation (indexed by the LRP) began before Task 1 central operations had finished.
  When there was no dimensional overlap, backward correspondence effects could not
  be measured, but the LRP data confirmed that parallel response activation still
  occurred. We argue that parallel response activation does occur, perhaps due to
  accidental activation of Task 2 mapping rules when the intention is to selectively
  execute Task 1 mapping rules.'
