abstract: Oscillatory neuronal activity may provide a mechanism for dynamic network
  coordination. Rhythmic neuronal interactions can be quantified using multiple metrics,
  each with their own advantages and disadvantages. This tutorial will review and
  summarize current analysis methods used in the field of invasive and non-invasive
  electrophysiology to study the dynamic connections between neuronal populations.
  First, we review metrics for functional connectivity, including coherence, phase
  synchronization, phase-slope index, and Granger causality, with the specific aim
  to provide an intuition for how these metrics work, as well as their quantitative
  definition. Next, we highlight a number of interpretational caveats and common pitfalls
  that can arise when performing functional connectivity analysis, including the common
  reference problem, the signal to noise ratio problem, the volume conduction problem,
  the common input problem, and the sample size bias problem. These pitfalls will
  be illustrated by presenting a set of MATLAB-scripts, which can be executed by the
  reader to simulate each of these potential problems. We discuss how these issues
  can be addressed using current methods.
