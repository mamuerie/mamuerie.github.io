 abstract = {Female undergraduates performed an easy (fatigue low) or difficult (fatigue high) scanning task and then were presented mental arithmetic problems with instructions that they would earn a high or low chance of winning a prize if they did as well as or better than 50% of those who had performed previously. As expected, blood pressure responses in the second work period rose or tended to rise with fatigue where the chance of winning was high. By contrast, the responses tended weakly to decline with fatigue where the chance of winning was low. The pressure findings support the suggestion of a recent fatigue analysis that success importance should moderate fatigue influence on CV responses to a challenge so long as fatigued performers view success as possible. They also conceptually replicate previous fatigue results and provide a special class of evidence that fatigue influence on CV response is mediated by effort.},
