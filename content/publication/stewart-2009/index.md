abstract: Female undergraduates performed an easy (fatigue low) or difficult (fatigue
  high) scanning task and then were presented mental arithmetic problems with instructions
  that they would earn a high or low chance of winning a prize if they did as well
  as or better than 50% of those who had performed previously. As expected, blood
  pressure responses in the second work period rose or tended to rise with fatigue
  where the chance of winning was high. By contrast, the responses tended weakly to
  decline with fatigue where the chance of winning was low. The pressure findings
  support the suggestion of a recent fatigue analysis that success importance should
  moderate fatigue influence on CV responses to a challenge so long as fatigued performers
  view success as possible. They also conceptually replicate previous fatigue results
  and provide a special class of evidence that fatigue influence on CV response is
  mediated by effort.
