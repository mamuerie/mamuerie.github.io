abstract: A key challenge for cognitive neuroscience is determining how mental representations
  map onto patterns of neural activity. Recently, researchers have started to address
  this question by applying sophisticated pattern-classification algorithms to distributed
  (multi-voxel) patterns of functional MRI data, with the goal of decoding the information
  that is represented in the subject's brain at a particular point in time. This multi-voxel
  pattern analysis (MVPA) approach has led to several impressive feats of mind reading.
  More importantly, MVPA methods constitute a useful new tool for advancing our understanding
  of neural information processing. We review how researchers are using MVPA methods
  to characterize neural coding and information processing in domains ranging from
  visual perception to memory search.
