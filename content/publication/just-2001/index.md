abstract: One of the classic questions about human thinking concerns the limited ability
  to perform two cognitive tasks concurrently, such as a novice driver's difficulty
  in simultaneously driving and conversing. Limitations on the concurrent performance
  of two unrelated tasks challenge the tacitly assumed independence of two brain systems
  that seemingly have little overlap. The current study used fMRI (functional magnetic
  resonance imaging) to measure cortical activation during the concurrent performance
  of two high-level cognitive tasks that involve different sensory modalities and
  activate largely nonoverlapping areas of sensory and association cortex. One task
  was auditory sentence comprehension, and the other was the mental rotation of visually
  depicted 3-D objects. If the neural systems underlying the two tasks functioned
  independently, then in the dual task the brain activation in the main areas supporting
  the cognitive processing should be approximately the conjunction of the activation
  for each of the two tasks performed alone. We found instead that in the dual task,
  the activation in association areas (primarily temporal and parietal areas of cortex)
  was substantially less than the sum of the activation when the two tasks were performed
  alone, suggesting some mutual constraint among association areas. A similar result
  was obtained for sensory areas as well.
