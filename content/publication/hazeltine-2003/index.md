abstract: 'The present study used the flanker task [Percept. Psychophys. 16 (1974)
  143] to identify neural structures that support response selection processes, and
  to determine which of these structures respond differently depending on the type
  of stimulus material associated with the response. Participants performed two versions
  of the flanker task while undergoing event-related functional magnetic resonance
  imaging (fMRI). Both versions of the task required participants to respond to a
  central stimulus regardless of the responses associated with simultaneously presented
  flanking stimuli, but one used colored circle stimuli and the other used letter
  stimuli. Competition-related activation was identified by comparing Incongruent
  trials, in which the flanker stimuli indicated a different response than the central
  stimulus, to Neutral stimuli, in which the flanker stimuli indicated no response.
  A region within the right inferior frontal gyrus exhibited significantly more competition-related
  activation for the color stimuli, whereas regions within the middle frontal gyri
  of both hemispheres exhibited more competition-related activation for the letter
  stimuli. The border of the right middle frontal and inferior frontal gyri and the
  anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were significantly activated by competition for
  both types of stimulus materials. Posterior foci demonstrated a similar pattern:
  left inferior parietal cortex showed greater competition-related activation for
  the letters, whereas right parietal cortex was significantly activated by competition
  for both materials. These findings indicate that the resolution of response competition
  invokes both material-dependent and material-independent processes.'
