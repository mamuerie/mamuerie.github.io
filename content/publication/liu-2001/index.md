abstract: Experimental designs for event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging
  can be characterized by both their detection power, a measure of the ability to
  detect an activation, and their estimation efficiency, a measure of the ability
  to estimate the shape of the hemodynamic response. Randomized designs offer maximum
  estimation efficiency but poor detection power, while block designs offer good detection
  power at the cost of minimum estimation efficiency. Periodic single-trial designs
  are poor by both criteria. We present here a theoretical model of the relation between
  estimation efficiency and detection power and show that the observed trade-off between
  efficiency and power is fundamental. Using the model, we explore the properties
  of semirandom designs that offer intermediate trade-offs between efficiency and
  power. These designs can simultaneously achieve the estimation efficiency of randomized
  designs and the detection power of block designs at the cost of increasing the length
  of an experiment by less than a factor of 2. Experimental designs can also be characterized
  by their predictability, a measure of the ability to circumvent confounds such as
  habituation and anticipation. We examine the relation between detection power, estimation
  efficiency, and predictability and show that small increases in predictability can
  offer significant gains in detection power with only a minor decrease in estimation
  efficiency.
