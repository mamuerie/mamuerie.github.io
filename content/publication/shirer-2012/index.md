abstract: Decoding specific cognitive states from brain activity constitutes a major
  goal of neuroscience. Previous studies of brain-state classification have focused
  largely on decoding brief, discrete events and have required the timing of these
  events to be known. To date, methods for decoding more continuous and purely subject-driven
  cognitive states have not been available. Here, we demonstrate that free-streaming
  subject-driven cognitive states can be decoded using a novel whole-brain functional
  connectivity analysis. Ninety functional regions of interest (ROIs) were defined
  across 14 large-scale resting-state brain networks to generate a 3960 cell matrix
  reflecting whole-brain connectivity. We trained a classifier to identify specific
  patterns of whole-brain connectivity as subjects rested quietly, remembered the
  events of their day, subtracted numbers, or (silently) sang lyrics. In a leave-one-out
  cross-validation, the classifier identified these 4 cognitive states with 84% accuracy.
  More critically, the classifier achieved 85% accuracy when identifying these states
  in a second, independent cohort of subjects. Classification accuracy remained high
  with imaging runs as short as 30-60 s. At all temporal intervals assessed, the 90
  functionally defined ROIs outperformed a set of 112 commonly used structural ROIs
  in classifying cognitive states. This approach should enable decoding a myriad of
  subject-driven cognitive states from brief imaging data samples.
