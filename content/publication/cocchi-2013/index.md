abstract: The human brain is characterized by a remarkable ability to adapt its information
  processing based on current goals. This ability, which is encompassed by the psychological
  construct of cognitive control, involves activity throughout large-scale, specialized
  brain systems that support segregated functions at rest and during active task performance.
  Based on recent research, we propose an account in which control functions rely
  on transitory changes in patterns of cooperation and competition between neural
  systems. This account challenges current conceptualizations of control as relying
  on segregated or antagonistic activity of specialized brain systems. Accordingly,
  we argue that the study of transitory task-based interactions between brain systems
  is critical to understanding the flexibility of normal cognitive control and its
  disruption in pathological conditions.
