abstract: Our brain is a network. It consists of spatially distributed, but functionally
  linked regions that continuously share information with each other. Interestingly,
  recent advances in the acquisition and analysis of functional neuroimaging data
  have catalyzed the exploration of functional connectivity in the human brain. Functional
  connectivity is defined as the temporal dependency of neuronal activation patterns
  of anatomically separated brain regions and in the past years an increasing body
  of neuroimaging studies has started to explore functional connectivity by measuring
  the level of co-activation of resting-state fMRI time-series between brain regions.
  These studies have revealed interesting new findings about the functional connections
  of specific brain regions and local networks, as well as important new insights
  in the overall organization of functional communication in the brain network. Here
  we present an overview of these new methods and discuss how they have led to new
  insights in core aspects of the human brain, providing an overview of these novel
  imaging techniques and their implication to neuroscience. We discuss the use of
  spontaneous resting-state fMRI in determining functional connectivity, discuss suggested
  origins of these signals, how functional connections tend to be related to structural
  connections in the brain network and how functional brain communication may form
  a key role in cognitive performance. Furthermore, we will discuss the upcoming field
  of examining functional connectivity patterns using graph theory, focusing on the
  overall organization of the functional brain network. Specifically, we will discuss
  the value of these new functional connectivity tools in examining believed connectivity
  diseases, like Alzheimer's disease, dementia, schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis.
