abstract: The extent to which cortical plasticity is retained in old age remains an
  understudied question, despite large social and scientific implications of such
  a result. Neuroimaging research reports individual differences in age-related activation,
  thereby educing speculation that some degree of plasticity may remain throughout
  life. We conducted a randomized longitudinal dual-task training study to investigate
  if performance improvements (a) change the magnitude or pattern of fMRI activation,
  thereby suggesting some plasticity retention in old age and (b) result in a reduction
  in asymmetry and an increase in age differences in fMRI activation as a compensatory
  model of performance-related activation predicts. Performance improvements were
  correlated with an increase in hemispheric asymmetry and a reduction in age differences
  in ventral and dorsal prefrontal activation. These results provide evidence for
  plasticity in old age and are discussed in relation to an alternative argument for
  the role of reduced asymmetry in performance improvements.
