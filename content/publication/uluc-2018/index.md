abstract: Brain activity in frontal regions has been found to represent frequency
  information with a parametric code during working memory delay phases. The mental
  representation of frequencies has furthermore been shown to be modality independent
  in non-human primate electrophysiology and human EEG studies, suggesting frontal
  regions encoding quantitative information in a supramodal manner. A recent fMRI
  study using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) supports an overlapping multimodal
  network for the maintenance of visual and tactile frequency information over frontal
  and parietal brain regions. The present study extends the investigation of working
  memory representation of frequency information to the auditory domain. To this aim,
  we used MVPA on fMRI data recorded during an auditory frequency maintenance task.
  A support vector regression analysis revealed working memory information in auditory
  association areas and, consistent with earlier findings of parametric working memory,
  in a frontoparietal network. A direct comparison to an analogous dataset of vibrotactile
  parametric working memory revealed an overlap of information coding in prefrontal
  regions, particularly in the right inferior frontal gyrus. Therefore, our findings
  indicate that the prefrontal cortex represents frequency-specific working memory
  content irrespective of the modality as has been now also revealed for the auditory
  modality.
