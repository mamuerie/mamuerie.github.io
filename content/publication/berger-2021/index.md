abstract: In response time (RT) research, RT outliers are typically excluded from
  statistical analysis to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Nevertheless, there exist
  several methods for outlier exclusion. This poses the question, how these methods
  differ with respect to recovering the uncontaminated RT distribution. In the present
  simulation study, two RT distributions with a given population difference were simulated
  in each iteration. RTs were replaced by outliers following two different approaches.
  The first approach generated outliers at the tails of the distribution, the second
  one inserted outliers overlapping with the genuine RT distribution. We applied ten
  different outlier exclusion methods and tested, how many pairs of distributions
  significantly differed. Outlier exclusion methods were compared in terms of bias.
  Bias was defined as the deviation of the proportion of significant differences after
  outlier exclusion from the proportion of significant differences in the uncontaminated
  samples (before introducing outliers). Our results showed large differences in bias
  between the exclusion methods. Some methods showed a high rate of Type-I errors
  and should therefore clearly not be used. Overall, our results showed that applying
  an exclusion method based on z-scores / standard deviations introduced only small
  biases, while the absence of outlier exclusion showed the largest absolute bias.
