abstract: 'Doing two things at once (vs. one in isolation) usually yields performance
  costs. Such decrements are often distributed asymmetrically between the two actions
  involved, reflecting different processing priorities. A previous study (Huestegge
  & Koch, 2013) demonstrated that the particular effector systems associated with
  the two actions can determine the pattern of processing priorities: Vocal responses
  were prioritized over manual responses, as indicated by smaller performance costs
  (associated with dual-action demands) for the former. However, this previous study
  only involved auditory stimulation (for both actions). Given that previous research
  on input-output modality compatibility in dual tasks suggested that pairing auditory
  input with vocal output represents a particularly advantageous mapping, the question
  arises whether the observed vocal-over-manual prioritization was merely a consequence
  of auditory stimulation. To resolve this issue, we conducted a manual-vocal dual
  task study using either only auditory or only visual stimuli for both responses.
  We observed vocal-over-manual prioritization in both stimulus modality conditions.
  This suggests that input-output modality mappings can (to some extent) attenuate,
  but not abolish/reverse effector-based prioritization. Taken together, effector
  system pairings appear to have a more substantial impact on capacity allocation
  policies in dual-task control than input-output modality combinations.'
