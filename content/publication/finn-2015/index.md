abstract: "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies typically collapse
  data from many subjects, but brain functional organization varies between individuals.
  Here we establish that this individual variability is both robust and reliable,
  using data from the Human Connectome Project to demonstrate that functional connectivity
  profiles act as a 'fingerprint' that can accurately identify subjects from a large
  group. Identification was successful across scan sessions and even between task
  and rest conditions, indicating that an individual's connectivity profile is intrinsic,
  and can be used to distinguish that individual regardless of how the brain is engaged
  during imaging. Characteristic connectivity patterns were distributed throughout
  the brain, but the frontoparietal network emerged as most distinctive. Furthermore,
  we show that connectivity profiles predict levels of fluid intelligence: the same
  networks that were most discriminating of individuals were also most predictive
  of cognitive behavior. Results indicate the potential to draw inferences about single
  subjects on the basis of functional connectivity fMRI."
