abstract: Cognitive fatigability is conventionally quantified as the increase over
  time in either mean reaction time (RT) or error rate from two or more time periods
  during sustained performance of a prolonged cognitive task. There is evidence indicating
  that these mean performance measures may not sufficiently reflect the response characteristics
  of cognitive fatigue. We hypothesized that changes in intraindividual variability
  over time would be a more sensitive and ecologically meaningful metric for investigations
  of fatigability of cognitive performance. To test the hypothesis fifteen young adults
  were recruited. Trait fatigue perceptions in various domains were assessed with
  the Multidimensional Fatigue Index (MFI). Behavioral data were then recorded during
  performance of a three-hour continuous cued Stroop task. Results showed that intraindividual
  variability, as quantified by the coefficient of variation of RT, increased linearly
  over the course of three hours and demonstrated a significantly greater effect size
  than mean RT or accuracy. Change in intraindividual RT variability over time was
  significantly correlated with relevant subscores of the MFI including reduced activity,
  reduced motivation and mental fatigue. While change in mean RT over time was also
  correlated with reduced motivation and mental fatigue, these correlations were significantly
  smaller than those associated with intraindividual RT variability. RT distribution
  analysis using an ex-Gaussian model further revealed that change in intraindividual
  variability over time reflects an increase in the exponential component of variance
  and may reflect attentional lapses or other breakdowns in cognitive control. These
  results suggest that intraindividual variability and its change over time provide
  important metrics for measuring cognitive fatigability and may prove useful for
  inferring the underlying neuronal mechanisms of both perceptions of fatigue and
  objective changes in performance.
