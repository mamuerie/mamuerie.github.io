abstract: 'Dopamine modulates complex cognitive functions like working memory and
  cognitive control. It is widely accepted that an optimal level of prefrontal dopamine
  supports working memory performance. In the present study we used a molecular genetic
  approach to test whether the optimal activity of the dopamine system for different
  component processes of working memory is additionally related to the availability
  of dopamine D2 receptors. We sought evidence for this assumption by investigating
  the interaction effect (epistasis) of variations in two dopaminergic candidate genes:
  the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val(158)Met polymorphism, which has been
  shown to influence prefrontal dopamine concentration, and the DRD2/ANKK1-Taq-Ia
  polymorphism, which has been related to the density of D2 receptors. Our results
  show that COMT effects on working memory performance are modulated by the DRD2/ANKK1-TAQ-Ia
  polymorphism and the specific working memory component process under investigation.
  Val-participants--supposedly characterized by increased prefrontal dopamine concentrations--outperformed
  Val+ participants in the manipulation of working memory contents, but only when
  D2 receptor density could be considered to be high. No such effect was present for
  passive maintenance of working memory contents or for maintenance in the face of
  distracting information. This beneficial effect of a balance between prefrontal
  dopamine availability and D2 receptor density reveals the importance of considering
  epistasis effects and different working memory subprocesses in genetic association
  studies.'
