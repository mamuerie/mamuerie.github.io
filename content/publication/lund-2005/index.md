abstract: 'Functional MRI (fMRI) carries the potential for non-invasive measurements
  of brain activity. Typically, what are referred to as activation images are actually
  thresholded statistical parametric maps. These maps possess large inter-session
  variability. This is especially problematic when applying fMRI to pre-surgical planning
  because of a higher requirement for intra-subject precision. The purpose of this
  study was to investigate the impact of residual movement artefacts on intra-subject
  and inter-subject variability in the observed fMRI activation. Ten subjects were
  examined using three different word-generation tasks. Two of the subjects were examined
  10 times on 10 different days using the same paradigms. We systematically investigated
  one approach of correcting for residual movement effects: the inclusion of regressors
  describing movement-related effects in the design matrix of a General Linear Model
  (GLM). The data were analysed with and without modeling the residual movement artefacts
  and the impact on inter-session variance was assessed using F-contrasts. Inclusion
  of motion parameters in the analysis significantly reduced both the intra-subject
  as well as the inter-subject-variance.'
