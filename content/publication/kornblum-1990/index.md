abstract: The classic problem of stimulus-response (S-R) compatibility (SRC) is addressed.
  A cognitive model is proposed that views the stimulus and response sets in S-R ensembles
  as categories with dimensions that may or may not overlap. If they do overlap, the
  task may be compatible or incompatible, depending on the assigned S-R mapping. If
  they do not overlap, the task is noncompatible regardless of the assigned mapping.
  The overlapping dimensions may be relevant or not. The model provides a systematic
  account of SRC effects, a taxonomy of simple performance tasks that were hitherto
  thought to be unrelated, and suggestive parallels between these tasks and the experimental
  paradigms that have traditionally been used to study attentional, controlled, and
  automatic processes.
