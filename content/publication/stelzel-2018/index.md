abstract: There is evidence for cortical contribution to the regulation of human postural
  control. Interference from concurrently performed cognitive tasks supports this
  notion, and the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) has been suggested to play a prominent
  role in the processing of purely cognitive as well as cognitive-postural dual tasks.
  The degree of cognitive-motor interference varies greatly between individuals, but
  it is unresolved whether individual differences in the recruitment of specific lPFC
  regions during cognitive dual tasking are associated with individual differences
  in cognitive-motor interference. Here, we investigated inter-individual variability
  in a cognitive-postural multitasking situation in healthy young adults (n = 29)
  in order to relate these to inter-individual variability in lPFC recruitment during
  cognitive multitasking. For this purpose, a one-back working memory task was performed
  either as single task or as dual task in order to vary cognitive load. Participants
  performed these cognitive single and dual tasks either during upright stance on
  a balance pad that was placed on top of a force plate or during fMRI measurement
  with little to no postural demands. We hypothesized dual one-back task performance
  to be associated with lPFC recruitment when compared to single one-back task performance.
  In addition, we expected individual variability in lPFC recruitment to be associated
  with postural performance costs during concurrent dual one-back performance. As
  expected, behavioral performance costs in postural sway during dual-one back performance
  largely varied between individuals and so did lPFC recruitment during dual one-back
  performance. Most importantly, individuals who recruited the right mid-lPFC to a
  larger degree during dual one-back performance also showed greater postural sway
  as measured by larger performance costs in total center of pressure displacements.
  This effect was selective to the high-load dual one-back task and suggests a crucial
  role of the right lPFC in allocating resources during cognitive-motor interference.
  Our study provides further insight into the mechanisms underlying cognitive-motor
  multitasking and its impairments.
