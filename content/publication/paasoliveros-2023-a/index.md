abstract: Difficulties in performing two tasks at once can arise from several sources
  and usually increase in advanced age. Tasks with concurrent bimodal (e.g., manual
  and oculomotor) responding to single stimuli consistently revealed crosstalk between
  conflicting response codes as a relevant source. However, how this finding translates
  to unimodal (i.e., manual only) response settings and how it is affected by age
  remains open. To address this issue, we had young and older adults respond to high-
  or low-pitched tones with one (single task) or both hands concurrently (dual task).
  Responses were either compatible or incompatible with the pitch. When responses
  with the same level of compatibility were combined in dual-task conditions, their
  response codes were congruent to each other, whereas combining a compatible and
  an incompatible response created mutually incongruent (i.e., conflicting) response
  codes, potentially inducing detrimental crosstalk. Across age groups, dual-task
  costs indeed were overall highest with response-code incongruency. In these trials,
  compatible responses exhibited higher costs than incompatible ones, even after removing
  trials with strongly synchronized responses. This underadditive cost asymmetry argues
  against mutual crosstalk as the sole source of interference and corroborates notions
  of strategic prioritization of limited processing capacity based on mapping-selection
  difficulty. As expected, the effects of incongruent response codes were found to
  be especially deleterious in older adults, supporting assumptions of age-related
  deficits in multiple-action control at the level of task-shielding. Overall, our
  results suggest that aging is linked to higher response confusability and less efficient
  flexibility for capacity sharing in dual-task settings.
