abstract: 'The human brain exhibits fundamental limitations in multitasking. When
  subjects engage in a primary task, their ability to respond to a second stimulus
  is degraded. Two competing models of multitasking have been proposed: either cognitive
  resources are shared between tasks, or they are allocated to each task serially.
  Using a novel combination of magneto-encephalography and multivariate pattern analyses,
  we obtained a precise spatio-temporal decomposition of the brain processes at work
  during multitasking. We discovered that each task relies on a sequence of brain
  processes. These sequences can operate in parallel for several hundred milliseconds
  but beyond ∼ 500 ms, they repel each other: processes evoked by the first task are
  shortened, while processes of the second task are either lengthened or postponed.
  These results contradict the resource-sharing model and further demonstrate that
  the serial model is incomplete. We therefore propose a new theoretical framework
  for the computational architecture underlying multitasking.'
