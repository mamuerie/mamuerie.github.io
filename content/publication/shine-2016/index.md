abstract: Higher brain function relies upon the ability to flexibly integrate information
  across specialized communities of brain regions; however, it is unclear how this
  mechanism manifests over time. In this study, we used time-resolved network analysis
  of fMRI data to demonstrate that the human brain traverses~between functional states
  that maximize either segregation into tight-knit communities or integration across
  otherwise disparate neural regions. Integrated states enable faster and more accurate
  performance on a cognitive task, and are associated with dilations in pupil diameter,
  suggesting that ascending neuromodulatory systems may govern the transition between
  these alternative~modes of brain function. Together, our results confirm a direct
  link between cognitive performance and the dynamic reorganization of the network
  structure of the brain.
