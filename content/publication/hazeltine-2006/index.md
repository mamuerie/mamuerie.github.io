abstract: Recent debate regarding dual-task performance has focused on whether costs
  result from limitations in central capacity, and whether central operations can
  be performed in parallel. While these questions are controversial, the dominant
  models of dual-task performance share the assumption that central operations are
  generic--that is, their interactions are independent of stimulus and response modalities.
  To examine these issues, we conducted a series of dual-task experiments with different
  input and output modality pairings. One condition combined a visual-manual task
  with an auditory-vocal task, and the other condition reversed the input-output pairings,
  combining a visual-vocal task with an auditory-manual task. Input/output modality
  pairings proved to be a key factor; throughout practice, dual-task costs were generally
  more than twice as large with visual-vocal/auditory-manual tasks than with the opposite
  arrangement of modalities (Experiments 1 and 2). These differences could be explained
  neither by competition for peripheral resources nor by differences in single-task
  response times (Experiment 3). Moreover, the persistent dual-task costs did not
  appear to stem from a central bottleneck. Contrary to the dominant models of dual-task
  performance, we propose that central interference between tasks depends not just
  on the duration of central operations, nor just strategic adaptation, but also on
  the content of those operations. Implications for structural and strategic accounts
  of dual-task interference are discussed.
