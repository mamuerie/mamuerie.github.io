abstract: \"This volume provides an overview of cutting-edge methods currently being
  used in cognitive psychology. These theoretical insights and methodological innovations
  are not as widely represented within the cognitive psychological literature as more
  traditional methods, but they are likely to appear with increasing frequency in
  coming years. As such, it is not a typical research methods volume that covers familiar
  ground, but it is in some ways speculative and also instructive to psychologists
  unfamiliar with the new methods\"--
