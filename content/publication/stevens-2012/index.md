abstract: BACKGROUND  Cognitive abilities, such as working memory, differ among people;
  however, individuals also vary in their own day-to-day cognitive performance. One
  potential source of cognitive variability may be fluctuations in the functional
  organization of neural systems. The degree to which the organization of these functional
  networks is optimized may relate to the effective cognitive functioning of the individual.
  Here we specifically examine how changes in the organization of large-scale networks
  measured via resting state functional connectivity MRI and graph theory track changes
  in working memory capacity.  METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS  Twenty-two participants
  performed a test of working memory capacity and then underwent resting-state fMRI.
  Seventeen subjects repeated the protocol three weeks later. We applied graph theoretic
  techniques to measure network organization on 34 brain regions of interest (ROI).
  Network modularity, which measures the level of integration and segregation across
  sub-networks, and small-worldness, which measures global network connection efficiency,
  both predicted individual differences in memory capacity; however, only modularity
  predicted intra-individual variation across the two sessions. Partial correlations
  controlling for the component of working memory that was stable across sessions
  revealed that modularity was almost entirely associated with the variability of
  working memory at each session. Analyses of specific sub-networks and individual
  circuits were unable to consistently account for working memory capacity variability.  CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE  The
  results suggest that the intrinsic functional organization of an a priori defined
  cognitive control network measured at rest provides substantial information about
  actual cognitive performance. The association of network modularity to the variability
  in an individual's working memory capacity suggests that the organization of this
  network into high connectivity within modules and sparse connections between modules
  may reflect effective signaling across brain regions, perhaps through the modulation
  of signal or the suppression of the propagation of noise.
