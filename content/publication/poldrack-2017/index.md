abstract: Functional neuroimaging techniques have transformed our ability to probe
  the neurobiological basis of behaviour and are increasingly being applied by the
  wider neuroscience community. However, concerns have recently been raised that the
  conclusions that are drawn from some human neuroimaging studies are either spurious
  or not generalizable. Problems such as low statistical power, flexibility in data
  analysis, software errors and a lack of direct replication apply to many fields,
  but perhaps particularly to functional MRI. Here, we discuss these problems, outline
  current and suggested best practices, and describe how we think the field should
  evolve to produce the most meaningful and reliable answers to neuroscientific questions.
