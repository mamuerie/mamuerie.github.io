abstract: Performing high-quality research is a challenging endeavor, especially for
  early career researchers (ECRs) in many fields of psychological science. Most research
  is characterized by experiential learning, which can be time-consuming, error-prone,
  and frustrating. While most institutions provide selected resources to help researchers
  with their projects, these resources are often expensive, spread out, hard to find,
  and difficult to compare with one another in terms of reliability, validity, usability,
  and practicability. A comprehensive overview of resources that are useful for researchers
  in psychological science is missing. To address this issue, we created ARIADNE –
  a living and interactive resource navigator that helps to use and search a dynamically
  updated database of resources. This tutorial aims at guiding researchers through
  a standard research project using ARIADNE along the way. The open access database
  covers a growing list of resources useful for each step of a research project, ranging
  from the planning and designing of a study, over the collection and analysis of
  the data, to the writing and disseminating of findings. We provide 1) a step-by-step
  guide on how to perform a research project (in the fields of biological psychology
  and neuroscience as a case example, but with broad application to neighboring fields),
  and 2) an overview of resources that are useful at different project steps. By explicitly
  highlighting open access and open-source resources, we level the playing field for
  researchers from underprivileged countries or institutions, thereby facilitating
  open, fair, and reproducible research in the psychological sciences.
