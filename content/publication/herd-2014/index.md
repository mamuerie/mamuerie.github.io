abstract: We use a biologically grounded neural network model to investigate the brain
  mechanisms underlying individual differences specific to the selection and instantiation
  of representations that exert cognitive control in task switching. Existing computational
  models of task switching do not focus on individual differences and so cannot explain
  why task switching abilities are separable from other executive function (EF) abilities
  (such as response inhibition). We explore hypotheses regarding neural mechanisms
  underlying the \"Shifting-Specific\" and \"Common EF\" components of EF proposed
  in the Unity/Diversity model (Miyake & Friedman, 2012) and similar components in
  related theoretical frameworks. We do so by adapting a well-developed neural network
  model of working memory (Prefrontal cortex, Basal ganglia Working Memory or PBWM;
  Hazy, Frank, & O'Reilly, 2007) to task switching and the Stroop task, and comparing
  its behavior on those tasks under a variety of individual difference manipulations.
  Results are consistent with the hypotheses that variation specific to task switching
  (i.e., Shifting-Specific) may be related to uncontrolled, automatic persistence
  of goal representations, whereas variation general to multiple EFs (i.e., Common
  EF) may be related to the strength of PFC representations and their effect on processing
  in the remainder of the cognitive system. Moreover, increasing signal to noise ratio
  in PFC, theoretically tied to levels of tonic dopamine and a genetic polymorphism
  in the COMT gene, reduced Stroop interference but increased switch costs. This stability-flexibility
  tradeoff provides an explanation for why these two EF components sometimes show
  opposing correlations with other variables such as attention problems and self-restraint.
