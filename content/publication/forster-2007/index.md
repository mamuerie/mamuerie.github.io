abstract: 'Perceptual load has been found to be a powerful determinant of distractibility
  in laboratory tasks. The present study assessed how the effects of perceptual load
  on distractibility in the laboratory relate to individual differences in the likelihood
  of distractibility in daily life. Sixty-one subjects performed a response-competition
  task in which perceptual load was varied. As expected, individuals reporting high
  levels of distractibility (on the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, an established
  measure of distractibility in daily life) experienced greater distractor interference
  than did individuals reporting low levels. The critical finding, however, was that
  this relationship was confined to task conditions of low perceptual load: High perceptual
  load reduced distractor interference for all subjects, eliminating any individual
  differences. These findings suggest that the level of perceptual load in a task
  can predict whether individual differences in distractibility will be found and
  that high-load modifications of daily tasks may prove useful in preventing unwanted
  consequences of high distractibility.'
