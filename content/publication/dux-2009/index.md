abstract: "Our ability to multitask is severely limited: task performance deteriorates
  when we attempt to undertake two or more tasks simultaneously. Remarkably, extensive
  training can greatly reduce such multitasking costs. While it is not known how training
  alters the brain to solve the multitasking problem, it likely involves the prefrontal
  cortex given this brain region's purported role in limiting multitasking performance.
  Here, we show that the reduction of multitasking interference with training is not
  achieved by diverting the flow of information processing away from the prefrontal
  cortex or by segregating prefrontal cells into independent task-specific neuronal
  ensembles, but rather by increasing the speed of information processing in this
  brain region, thereby allowing multiple tasks to be processed in rapid succession.
  These results not only reveal how training leads to efficient multitasking, they
  also provide a mechanistic account of multitasking limitations, namely the poor
  speed of information processing in human prefrontal cortex."
