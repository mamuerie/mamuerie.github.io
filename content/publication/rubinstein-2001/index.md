abstract: In 4 experiments, participants alternated between different tasks or performed
  the same task repeatedly. The tasks for 2 of the experiments required responding
  to geometric objects in terms of alternative classification rules, and the tasks
  for the other 2 experiments required solving arithmetic problems in terms of alternative
  numerical operations. Performance was measured as a function of whether the tasks
  were familiar or unfamiliar, the rules were simple or complex, and visual cues were
  present or absent about which tasks should be performed. Task alternation yielded
  switching-time costs that increased with rule complexity but decreased with task
  cuing. These factor effects were additive, supporting a model of executive control
  that has goal-shifting and rule-activation stages for task switching. It appears
  that rule activation takes more time for switching from familiar to unfamiliar tasks
  than for switching in the opposite direction.
