abstract: The lateral prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia are known to be important
  for response selection processes, also in dual-task situations. However, response
  selection in dual-task situations can be achieved using different modes ranging
  from a parallel selection to a more serial selection of responses. Nothing is known
  whether differences in these processing modes during dual-tasking have distinct
  functional neuroanatomical correlates. In this fMRI study we analyzed performance
  in a psychological refractory period paradigm. In this paradigm we design a PRP
  task where we vary the frequency of short and long stimulus onset asynchronies between
  the two tasks. Using mathematical constraints we interpret the effects of this manipulation
  with respect to processing modes ranging from more serial to more parallel response
  selection. Contrastingly these blocks showed that response selection in dual-tasking
  under the constraint of more parallel processing is mediated by mechanisms operating
  at the striatal level, while response selection under the constraint of more serial
  processing is mediated via mechanisms operating in the lateral prefrontal cortex.
  The results suggest that lateral prefrontal and striatal regions are ‘optimized’
  for a certain processing modes in dual tasking.
