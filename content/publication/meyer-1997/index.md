abstract: "A new theoretical framework, executive-process interactive control (EPIC),
  is introduced for characterizing human performance of concurrent perceptual-motor
  and cognitive tasks. On the basis of EPIC, computational models may be formulated
  to simulate multiple-task performance under a variety of circumstances. These models
  account well for reaction-time data from representative situations such as the psychological
  refractory-period procedure. EPIC's goodness of fit supports several key conclusions:
  (a) At a cognitive level, people can apply distinct sets of production rules simultaneously
  for executing the procedures of multiple tasks; (b) people's capacity to process
  information at \\\"peripheral\\\" perceptual-motor levels is limited; (c) to cope
  with such limits and to satisfy task priorities, flexible scheduling strategies
  are used; and (d) these strategies are mediated by executive cognitive processes
  that coordinate concurrent tasks adaptively."
