abstract: There are declines with age in speed of processing, working memory, inhibitory
  function, and long-term memory, as well as decreases in brain structure size and
  white matter integrity. In the face of these decreases, functional imaging studies
  have demonstrated, somewhat surprisingly, reliable increases in prefrontal activation.
  To account for these joint phenomena, we propose the scaffolding theory of aging
  and cognition (STAC). STAC provides an integrative view of the aging mind, suggesting
  that pervasive increased frontal activation with age is a marker of an adaptive
  brain that engages in compensatory scaffolding in response to the challenges posed
  by declining neural structures and function. Scaffolding is a normal process present
  across the lifespan that involves use and development of complementary, alternative
  neural circuits to achieve a particular cognitive goal. Scaffolding is protective
  of cognitive function in the aging brain, and available evidence suggests that the
  ability to use this mechanism is strengthened by cognitive engagement, exercise,
  and low levels of default network engagement.
