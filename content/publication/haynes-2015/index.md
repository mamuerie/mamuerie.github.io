abstract: Human fMRI signals exhibit a spatial patterning that contains detailed information
  about a person's mental states. Using classifiers it is possible to access this
  information and study brain processes at the level of individual mental representations.
  The precise link between fMRI signals and neural population signals still needs
  to be unraveled. Also, the interpretation of classification studies needs to be
  handled with care. Nonetheless, pattern-based analyses make it possible to investigate
  human representational spaces in unprecedented ways, especially when combined with
  computational modeling.
