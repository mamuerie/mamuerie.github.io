abstract: Task-switching paradigms can shed light on cognitive and neural processes
  underlying attentional control mechanisms. An alternating runs task-switching paradigm
  (R. D. Rogers & S. Monsell, 1995) is used to identify ERP components associated
  with anticipatory and poststimulus components of task-switching processes. Subjects
  alternated between two tasks in a predictable series (AABB). Reaction time (RT)
  switch cost reduced with increasing response-stimulus (R-S) interval and a residual
  switch cost remained at the longest R-S interval. A switch-related positivity (D-Pos)
  developed in the R-S interval. D-Pos was time-locked to response onset, peaked around
  400 ms post-response onset, and was unaffected by task-set interference. A switch-related
  negativity (D-Neg) emerged after stimulus onset. D-Neg peaked earlier with increasing
  R-S interval and its amplitude and latency were affected by task-set interference.
  D-Pos and D-Neg were interpreted within current models of task-switching.
