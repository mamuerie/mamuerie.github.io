abstract: In daily life elderly adults exhibit deficits when dual-tasking is involved.
  So far these deficits have been verified on a behavioral level in dual-tasking.
  Yet, the neuronal architecture of these deficits in aging still remains to be explored
  especially when late-middle aged individuals around 60 years of age are concerned.
  Neuroimaging studies in young participants concerning dual-tasking were, among others,
  related to activity in middle frontal (MFG) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and
  the anterior insula (AI). According to the frontal lobe hypothesis of aging, alterations
  in these frontal regions (i.e., SFG and MFG) might be responsible for cognitive
  deficits. We measured brain activity using fMRI, while examining age-dependent variations
  in dual-tasking by utilizing the PRP (psychological refractory period) test. Behavioral
  data showed an increasing PRP effect in late-middle aged adults. The results suggest
  the age-related deteriorated performance in dual-tasking, especially in conditions
  of risen complexity. These effects are related to changes in networks involving
  the AI, the SFG and the MFG. The results suggest that different cognitive subprocesses
  are affected that mediate the observed dual-tasking problems in late-middle aged
  individuals.
