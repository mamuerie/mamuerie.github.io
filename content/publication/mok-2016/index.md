abstract: Working memory (WM) declines as we age and, because of its fundamental role
  in higher order cognition, this can have highly deleterious effects in daily life.
  We investigated whether older individuals benefit from flexible orienting of attention
  within WM to mitigate cognitive decline. We measured magnetoencephalography (MEG)
  in older adults performing a WM precision task with cues during the maintenance
  period that retroactively predicted the location of the relevant items for performance
  (retro-cues). WM performance of older adults significantly benefitted from retro-cues.
  Whereas WM maintenance declined with age, retro-cues conferred strong attentional
  benefits. A model-based analysis revealed an increase in the probability of recalling
  the target, a lowered probability of retrieving incorrect items or guessing, and
  an improvement in memory precision. MEG recordings showed that retro-cues induced
  a transient lateralization of alpha (8-14 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) oscillatory power.
  Interestingly, shorter durations of alpha/beta lateralization following retro-cues
  predicted larger cueing benefits, reinforcing recent ideas about the dynamic nature
  of access to WM representations. Our results suggest that older adults retain flexible
  control over WM, but individual differences in control correspond to differences
  in neural dynamics, possibly reflecting the degree of preservation of control in
  healthy aging.
