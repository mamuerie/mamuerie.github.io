abstract: 'The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) has a near-ubiquitous presence
  in the neuroscience of cognitive control. It has been implicated in a diversity
  of functions, from reward processing and performance monitoring to the execution
  of control and action selection. Here, we propose that this diversity can be understood
  in terms of a single underlying function: allocation of control based on an evaluation
  of the expected value of control (EVC). We present a normative model of EVC that
  integrates three critical factors: the expected payoff from a controlled process,
  the amount of control that must be invested to achieve that payoff, and the cost
  in terms of cognitive effort. We propose that dACC integrates this information,
  using it to determine whether, where and how much control to allocate. We then consider
  how the EVC model can explain the diverse array of findings concerning dACC function.'
