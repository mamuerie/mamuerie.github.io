abstract: There is often strong interference if a second target stimulus (T2) is presented
  before processing of a prior target stimulus (T1) is complete. In the \"Psychological
  Refractory Period\" (PRP) paradigm, responses are speeded and interference manifests
  as increased response time for T2. In the \"Attentional Blink\" (AB) paradigm, stimuli
  are masked and responses unspeeded; interference manifests as reduced T2 accuracy.
  While different causes have usually been considered for PRP and AB phenomena, recent
  evidence has supported a unified account based on a single, shared restriction on
  concurrent processing. Here we show that a full assessment of separate and shared
  resource limitations requires direct comparison of hybrid PRP/AB trials with corresponding
  pure PRP and AB cases. Randomizing trial types in such a comparison also brings
  substantial benefit in addressing possible changes in task preparation or readiness.
  The data from two such experiments--combining speeded auditory (SA) and unspeeded
  visual (UV) task events--provide clear evidence for both separate and shared resource
  limitations. Often interference is strongest for T1 and T2 events of the same type,
  reflecting predominantly different limitations in SA and UV processing. With modest
  increases in demand, however, interference between different event types can also
  be made arbitrarily large, reflecting arbitrarily important shared limitations.
  For even such simple tasks as these, T--T2 interference reflects a combination of
  relatively local and relatively global sources.
