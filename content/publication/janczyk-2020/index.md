abstract: In many if not all situations humans are engaged in more than one activity
  at the same time, that is, they multitask. In laboratory situations, even the combination
  of two simple motor tasks generally yields performance decrements in one or both
  tasks, compared with corresponding single task conditions. In contemporary models
  of dual tasking, these dual task costs are attributed to a capacity-limited stage
  of mentally specifying required responses. Ideomotor theory suggests that the generation
  of responses is a process of specifying goals, that is, desired future perceptual
  states (= effect anticipation). Based on this, we argue that effect anticipation
  is the process responsible for dual task costs. We substantiate this suggestion
  with results from several lines of research, showing that (a) effect anticipation
  coincides with a capacity-limited process in dual task experiments, (b) no dual
  task costs arise if no effects are to be anticipated in one of the tasks, (c) dual
  task costs vary as a function of a how well effects from two tasks fit together,
  and (d) monitoring the occurrence of effects also adds additional costs. These results
  are discussed in a common framework and in relation to other observations and fields.
