abstract: 'Understanding neurocognitive computations will require not just localizing
  cognitive information distributed throughout the brain but also determining how
  that information got there. We review recent advances in linking empirical and simulated
  brain network organization with cognitive information processing. Building on these
  advances, we offer a new framework for understanding the role of connectivity in
  cognition: network coding (encoding/decoding) models. These models utilize connectivity
  to specify the transfer of information via neural activity flow processes, successfully
  predicting the formation of cognitive representations in empirical neural data.
  The success of these models supports the possibility that localized neural functions
  mechanistically emerge (are computed) from distributed activity flow processes that
  are specified primarily by connectivity patterns.'
