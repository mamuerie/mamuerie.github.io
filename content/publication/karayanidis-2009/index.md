abstract: Task-switching studies show no behavioral benefit of partially informative
  cues. However, ERP evidence of an early cue-locked positivity elicited by both fully
  and partially informative cues suggests that both cues trigger an anticipatory component
  of task set reconfiguration (Nicholson, Karayanidis, Davies, & Michie, 2006). We
  examined this apparent discrepancy using a cued-trials task-switching paradigm with
  three tasks. The ERP finding of an early cue-locked positivity was replicated for
  both switch-to cues, which validly predicted an upcoming switch trial and specified
  the new task set, and switch-away cues, which validly predicted an upcoming switch
  trial but not the new task set. This component was not elicited by a noninformative
  cue that did not specify whether the task would switch or repeat. Switch-away cues
  resulted in more accurate but not faster responding than did noninformative cues.
  Modeling of decision processes confirmed a speed-accuracy trade-off between these
  conditions and a preparation benefit for both switch-to and switch-away cues. These
  results indicate that both fully and partially informative cues elicit an early
  anticipatory component of task set reconfiguration that is reflected in the early
  cue-locked positivity. We argue that the pattern of results is most consistent with
  a task set inhibition account of this early anticipatory component of task set reconfiguration.
