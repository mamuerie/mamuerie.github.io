abstract: Two experiments tested the hypothesis that task-induced mental fatigue is
  moderated by control over work scheduling. Participants worked for 2 hr on simulated
  office work, with control manipulated by a yoking procedure. Matched participants
  were assigned to conditions of either high control (HC) or low control (LC). HC
  participants decided their own task scheduling, whereas LC participants had to follow
  these fixed schedules. For Experiment 1, fatigue was higher in LC participants who
  worked harder, so Experiment 2 compared control effects in high- and low-workload
  groups. As predicted, the impact of workload was reduced under HC conditions, for
  subjective fatigue, and most secondary tasks and aftereffects. The findings are
  interpreted within the framework of compensatory control theory.
