abstract: 'Dual-task costs are thought to reflect the architecture of the cognitive
  processes that guide voluntary action. Thus, manipulations that affect dual-task
  costs can provide insight into how we represent and select behavior as well as allow
  us to better design machines and controls for safer, more efficient performance.
  This line of research has revealed that the sensory events that follow the responses
  (i.e., action effects) can affect dual-task performance even though the sensory
  events occur after the actions are produced. The present study assessed three hypotheses
  regarding how action effects impact dual-task performance: a monitoring bottleneck,
  central stage shortening, and crosstalk. Across two experiments, we manipulated
  the content of two concurrently-performed tasks: a visual task that used either
  spatial or nonspatial stimuli (Experiment 1) and an auditory task that used responses
  with or without experimentally-induced auditory action effects (Experiments 1 and
  2). In Experiment 1, dual-task costs were reduced when experimentally-induced auditory
  action effects were present, independent of the content of the visual task. In Experiment
  2, the dual-task costs depended on the content of the experimentally-induced action
  effects, such that costs were larger when action effects emphasized ordinal (number)
  information, which overlapped with the unmanipulated action effects from the visual
  spatial task. Strikingly, dual-task costs were reduced when added, post-response
  events supported greater separation between task representations relative to when
  no post-response events were added. These results support the crosstalk hypothesis,
  as action effects appear to alter task representations so that they emphasize different
  types of information, reducing the degree of crosstalk.'
