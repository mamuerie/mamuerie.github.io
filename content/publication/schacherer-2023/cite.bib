 abstract = {Dual-task costs are thought to reflect the architecture of the cognitive processes that guide voluntary action. Thus, manipulations that affect dual-task costs can provide insight into how we represent and select behavior as well as allow us to better design machines and controls for safer, more efficient performance. This line of research has revealed that the sensory events that follow the responses (i.e., action effects) can affect dual-task performance even though the sensory events occur after the actions are produced. The present study assessed three hypotheses regarding how action effects impact dual-task performance: a monitoring bottleneck, central stage shortening, and crosstalk. Across two experiments, we manipulated the content of two concurrently-performed tasks: a visual task that used either spatial or nonspatial stimuli (Experiment 1) and an auditory task that used responses with or without experimentally-induced auditory action effects (Experiments 1 and 2). In Experiment 1, dual-task costs were reduced when experimentally-induced auditory action effects were present, independent of the content of the visual task. In Experiment 2, the dual-task costs depended on the content of the experimentally-induced action effects, such that costs were larger when action effects emphasized ordinal (number) information, which overlapped with the unmanipulated action effects from the visual spatial task. Strikingly, dual-task costs were reduced when added, post-response events supported greater separation between task representations relative to when no post-response events were added. These results support the crosstalk hypothesis, as action effects appear to alter task representations so that they emphasize different types of information, reducing the degree of crosstalk.},
