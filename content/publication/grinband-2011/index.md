abstract: The dorsal medial frontal cortex (dMFC) is highly active during choice behavior.
  Though many models have been proposed to explain dMFC function, the conflict monitoring
  model is the most influential. It posits that dMFC is primarily involved in detecting
  interference between competing responses thus signaling the need for control. It
  accurately predicts increased neural activity and response time (RT) for incompatible
  (high-interference) vs. compatible (low-interference) decisions. However, it has
  been shown that neural activity can increase with time on task, even when no decisions
  are made. Thus, the greater dMFC activity on incompatible trials may stem from longer
  RTs rather than response conflict. This study shows that (1) the conflict monitoring
  model fails to predict the relationship between error likelihood and RT, and (2)
  the dMFC activity is not sensitive to congruency, error likelihood, or response
  conflict, but is monotonically related to time on task.
