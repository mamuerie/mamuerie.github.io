abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that dual-task performance in situations
  with two simultaneously presented tasks can be substantially improved with extensive
  practice. This improvement was related to the acquisition of task coordination skills.
  Earlier studies provided evidence that these skills result from hybrid practice,
  including dual and single tasks, but not from single-task practice. It is an open
  question, however, whether task coordination skills are independent from the specific
  practice situation and are transferable to new situations or whether they are non-transferable
  and task-specific. The present study, therefore, tested skill transfer in (1) a
  dual-task situation with identical tasks in practice and transfer, (2) a dual-task
  situation with two tasks changed from practice to transfer, and (3) a task switching
  situation with two sequentially presented tasks. Our findings are largely consistent
  with the assumption that task coordination skills are non-transferable and task-specific.
  We cannot, however, definitively reject the assumption of transferable skills when
  measuring error rates in the dual-task situation with two changed tasks after practice.
  In the task switching situation, single-task and hybrid practice both led to a transfer
  effect on mixing costs.
