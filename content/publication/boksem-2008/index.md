abstract: 'A framework for mental fatigue is proposed, that involves an integrated
  evaluation of both expected rewards and energetical costs associated with continued
  performance. Adequate evaluation of predicted rewards and potential risks of actions
  is essential for successful adaptive behaviour. However, while both rewards and
  punishments can motivate to engage in activities, both types of motivated behaviour
  are associated with energetical costs. We will review findings that suggest that
  the nucleus accumbens, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, insula and anterior cingulate
  cortex are involved evaluating both the potential rewards associated with performing
  a task, as well as assessing the energetical demands involved in task performance.
  Behaviour will only proceed if this evaluation turns out favourably towards spending
  (additional) energy. We propose that this evaluation of predicted rewards and energetical
  costs is central to the phenomenon of mental fatigue: people will no longer be motivated
  to engage in task performance when energetical costs are perceived to outweigh predicted
  rewards.'
