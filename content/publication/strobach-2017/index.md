abstract: The present study investigated the ability of older adults in contrast to
  younger adults to automatize new choice tasks as a result of simultaneous dual-task
  practice. Importantly, the study was carried out in conditions optimal for dual-task
  performance and task automatization. Despite this, the results of detailed analyses
  were not consistent with the assumption that either older or younger adults are
  able to automatize new choice tasks; neither group showed evidence of automatization.
  Even in analyses focusing on high dual-task performers (i.e., individuals who performed
  equally well in single and dual tasks) the results were not consistent with this
  assumption. Instead, it seems to be the case that both older and younger adults
  continue to use capacity-limited processes to process choice tasks after dual-task
  practice. These conclusions are consistent with findings from studies using single-task
  practice and tests of task automatization in dual tasks (Maquestiaux, LaguÃ«-Beauvais,
  Ruthruff, Hartley, & Bherer, 2010; Maquestiaux, Didierjean, Ruthruff, Chauvel, &
  Hartley, 2013). (PsycINFO Database Record
