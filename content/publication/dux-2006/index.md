abstract: When humans attempt to perform two tasks at once, execution of the first
  task usually leads to postponement of the second one. This task delay is thought
  to result from a bottleneck occurring at a central, amodal stage of information
  processing that precludes two response selection or decision-making operations from
  being concurrently executed. Using time-resolved functional magnetic resonance imaging
  (fMRI), here we present a neural basis for such dual-task limitations, e.g. the
  inability of the posterior lateral prefrontal cortex, and possibly the superior
  medial frontal cortex, to process two decision-making operations at once. These
  results suggest that a neural network of frontal lobe areas acts as a central bottleneck
  of information processing that severely limits our ability to multitask.
