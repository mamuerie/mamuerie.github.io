abstract: A prominent model of how the brain regulates attention proposes that the
  anterior cingulate cortex monitors the occurrence of conflict between incompatible
  response tendencies and signals this information to a cognitive control system in
  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Cognitive control is thought to resolve conflict
  through the attentional biasing of perceptual processing, emphasizing task-relevant
  stimulus information. It is not known, however, whether conflict resolution is mediated
  by amplifying neural representations of task-relevant information, inhibiting representations
  of task-irrelevant information, or both. Here we manipulated trial-by-trial levels
  of conflict and control during a Stroop task using face stimuli, while recording
  hemodynamic responses from human visual cortex specialized for face processing.
  We show that, in response to high conflict, cognitive control mechanisms enhance
  performance by transiently amplifying cortical responses to task-relevant information
  rather than by inhibiting responses to task-irrelevant information. These results
  implicate attentional target-feature amplification as the primary mechanism for
  conflict resolution through cognitive control.
