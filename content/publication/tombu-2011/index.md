abstract: Human information processing is characterized by bottlenecks that constrain
  throughput. These bottlenecks limit both what we can perceive and what we can act
  on in multitask settings. Although perceptual and response limitations are often
  attributed to independent information processing bottlenecks, it has recently been
  suggested that a common attentional limitation may be responsible for both. To date,
  however, evidence supporting the existence of such a “unified” bottleneck has been
  mixed. Here, we tested the unified bottleneck hypothesis using time-resolved fMRI.
  Experiment 1 isolated brain regions involved in the response selection bottleneck
  that limits speeded dual-task performance. These same brain regions were not only
  engaged by a perceptual encoding task in Experiment 2, their activity also tracked
  delays to a speeded decision-making task caused by concurrent perceptual encoding
  (Experiment 3). We conclude that a unified attentional bottleneck, including the
  inferior frontal junction, superior medial frontal cortex, and bilateral insula,
  temporally limits operations as diverse as perceptual encoding and decision-making.
