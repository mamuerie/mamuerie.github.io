abstract: Two related accounts of dual-task costs-multiple resource competition and
  crosstalk-explain why costs can be reduced when there is less overlap between the
  two tasks. However, distinguishing between competition for limited resources and
  crosstalk between concurrently performed operations has proven difficult. In the
  present study, we compared these two accounts with a dual-task paradigm in which
  participants were required to coordinate visual-manual and auditory-manual tasks
  with experimentally induced action effects. Critically, stimulus and response modalities
  were constant across conditions; what differed was the conceptual relationship between
  stimuli and action effects such that conceptual overlap was present either within
  or between tasks. We observed larger dual-task costs when related conceptual codes
  were present between tasks. We conclude that these results are best supported by
  the crosstalk account and that postresponse action effects are integrated into task
  representations engaged by central operations during response selection.
