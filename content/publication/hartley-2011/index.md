abstract: fMRI was used to explore age differences in the neural substrate of dual-task
  processing. Brain activations when there was a 100 ms SOA between tasks, and task
  overlap was high, were contrasted with activations when there was a 1000 ms SOA,
  and first task processing was largely complete before the second task began. Younger
  adults (M=21 yrs) showed activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and in parietal
  areas as well as in ventral medial frontal cortex and sub-lobar areas. Activations
  in older adults (M=71 yrs) did not differ significantly from younger adults except
  for higher activations in occipital and polar prefrontal cortex. The results were
  well fit by a model with two networks managing dual-task interference, a medial
  prefrontal network that detects changes in the stimulus situation and maps them
  to associated changes in the valence of response mappings and a lateral frontal-parietal
  network that initiates and carries out the shift from one task to the other. The
  additional activations in older adults as a group and the correlations of individual
  differences in activation with performance were consistent with recruitment within
  each of these networks. Alternative explanations such as hemispheric asymmetry reduction
  and reactive rather than proactive processing in older adults were not supported.
