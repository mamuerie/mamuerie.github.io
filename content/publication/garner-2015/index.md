abstract: Negotiating the information-rich sensory world often requires the concurrent
  management of multiple tasks. Despite this requirement, humans are thought to be
  poor at multitasking because of the processing limitations of frontoparietal and
  subcortical (FP-SC) brain regions. Although training is known to improve multitasking
  performance, it is unknown how the FP-SC system functionally changes to support
  improved multitasking. To address this question, we characterized the FP-SC changes
  that predict training outcomes using an individual differences approach. Participants
  (n = 100) performed single and multiple tasks in pre- and posttraining magnetic
  resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions interspersed by either a multitasking or an active-control
  training regimen. Multivoxel pattern analyses (MVPA) revealed that training induced
  multitasking improvements were predicted by divergence in the FP-SC blood oxygen
  level-dependent (BOLD) response patterns to the trained tasks. Importantly, this
  finding was only observed for participants who completed training on the component
  (single) tasks and their combination (multitask) and not for the control group.
  Therefore, the FP-SC system supports multitasking behavior by segregating constituent
  task representations.
