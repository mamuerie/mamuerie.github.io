abstract: Human skilled behavior requires preparatory processes that selectively make
  sensory and motor systems more efficient for perceiving the upcoming stimulus and
  performing the correct action. We review the literature concerning these preparatory
  processes as studied by response-cuing paradigm, and propose a model that accounts
  for the major findings. According to the Grouping Model, advance or precue information
  directs a dynamic process of subgroup making—that is, a process of stimulus- and
  response-set reconfiguration—whereby the internal representation of the task is
  simplified. The Grouping Model assigns a critical role to the unit of selection,
  with Gestalt factors and interresponse dependencies mediating the formation and
  strength of stimulus and response subgroups. In a series of five experiments, we
  manipulated perceptual and motoric grouping factors, and studied their independent
  and interactive effects on the pattern of precuing benefits. Generally, the results
  were consistent with the Grouping ModelÕs account of response-cuing effects.
