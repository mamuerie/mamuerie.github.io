abstract: We examined how variation in working memory (WM) capacity due to aging or
  individual differences among young adults is associated with intrinsic or resting-state
  anticorrelations, particularly between (1) the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC),
  a component of the default-mode network (DMN) that typically decreases in activation
  during external, attention-demanding tasks, and (2) the dorsolateral prefrontal
  cortex (DLPFC), a component of the fronto-parietal control network that supports
  executive functions and WM and typically increases in activation during attention-demanding
  tasks. We compared the magnitudes of MPFC-DLPFC anticorrelations between healthy
  younger and older participants (Experiment 1) and related the magnitudes of these
  anticorrelations to individual differences on two behavioral measures of WM capacity
  in two independent groups of young adults (Experiments 1 and 2). Relative to younger
  adults, older adults exhibited reductions in WM capacity and in MPFC-DLPFC anticorrelations.
  Within younger adults, greater MPFC-DLPFC anticorrelation at rest correlated with
  greater WM capacity. These findings show that variation in MPFC-DLPFC anticorrelations,
  whether related to aging or to individual differences, may reflect an intrinsic
  functional brain architecture supportive of WM capacity.
