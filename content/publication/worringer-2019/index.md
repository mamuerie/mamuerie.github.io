abstract: Although there are well-known limitations of the human cognitive system
  in performing two tasks simultaneously (dual-tasking) or alternatingly (task-switching),
  the question for a common vs. distinct neural basis of these multitasking limitations
  is still open. We performed two Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analyses of
  neuroimaging studies on dual-tasking or task-switching and tested for commonalities
  and differences in the brain regions associated with either domain. We found a common
  core network related to multitasking comprising bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS),
  left dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC), and right anterior insula. Meta-analytic contrasts
  revealed eight fronto-parietal clusters more consistently activated in dual-tasking
  (bilateral frontal operculum, dPMC, and anterior IPS, left inferior frontal sulcus
  and left inferior frontal gyrus) and, conversely, four clusters (left inferior frontal
  junction, posterior IPS, and precuneus as well as frontomedial cortex) more consistently
  activated in task-switching. Together with sub-analyses of preparation effects in
  task-switching, our results argue against purely passive structural processing limitations
  in multitasking. Based on these findings and drawing on current theorizing, we present
  a neuro-cognitive processing model of multitasking.
