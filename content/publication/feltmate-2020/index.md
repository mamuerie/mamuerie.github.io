abstract: "As part of a larger study on the effects of fatigue on various attentional
  and behavioural measures, we had participants complete a modified version of Luna
  et al.'s (J Neurosci Methods 306:77-87, Luna et al., J Neurosci Methods 306:77-87,
  2018) ANTI-Vea task (mANTI-Vea) at the beginning and end (pre/post) of each of two
  8-h testing sessions. Between these administrations of the mANTI-Vea our participants
  spent,~,6~h performing an intervening task. Our intent in this project was two-fold:
  first, to replicate the pattern of effects reported in Luna et al.'s original presentation
  of the ANTI-Vea; second, to assay the impact of fatigue on vigilance and attention
  by observing shifts in mANTI-Vea performance as a function of time on task and before
  versus after the intervening task. With time-on-task (the mANTI-Vea is divided into
  six sub-blocks) we observed that participants became increasingly conservative in
  their biases to respond towards infrequent targets, showed a decline in sensitivity,
  and lapsed in responding in the psychomotor vigilance task with greater frequency.
  In the pre/post comparison, we observed an increase in the proportion of lapses,
  but not in participants' response biases. Attentional network scores were found
  to be somewhat insensitive to our fatigue manipulations; the effect of time-on-task
  was only significant for orienting scores on RT, and our pre/post comparison was
  only significant for RT derived executive functioning scores."
