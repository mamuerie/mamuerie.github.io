abstract: The supervisory attentional system has been proposed to mediate non-routine,
  goal-oriented behaviour by guiding the selection and maintenance of the goal-relevant
  task schema. Here, we aimed to delineate the brain regions that mediate these high-level
  control processes via neuroimaging meta-analysis. In particular, we investigated
  the core neural correlates of a wide range of tasks requiring supervisory control
  for the suppression of a routine action in favour of another, non-routine one. Our
  sample comprised n=173 experiments employing go/no-go, stop-signal, Stroop or spatial
  interference tasks. Consistent convergence across all four paradigm classes was
  restricted to right anterior insula and inferior frontal junction, with anterior
  midcingulate cortex and pre-supplementary motor area being consistently involved
  in all but the go/no-go task. Taken together with lesion studies in patients, our
  findings suggest that the controlled activation and maintenance of adequate task
  schemata relies, across paradigms, on a right-dominant midcingulo-insular-inferior
  frontal core network. This also implies that the role of other prefrontal and parietal
  regions may be less domain-general than previously thought.
