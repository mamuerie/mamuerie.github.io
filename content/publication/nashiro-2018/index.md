abstract: It is well documented that older adults recruit additional brain regions
  compared to those recruited by younger adults while performing a wide variety of
  cognitive tasks. However, it is unclear how such age-related over-recruitment interacts
  with different types of cognitive control, and whether this over-recruitment is
  compensatory. To test this, we used a multitasking paradigm, which allowed us to
  examine age-related over-activation associated with three types of cognitive costs
  (i.e., global switch, local switch, compatibility-switch costs). We found age-related
  impairments in global switch cost (GSC), evidenced by slower response times for
  maintaining and coordinating two tasks vs. performing only one task. However, no
  age-related declines were observed in either local switch cost (LSC), a cognitive
  cost associated with switching between the two tasks while maintaining two task
  loads, or compatibility-switch cost (CSC), a cognitive cost associated with incompatible
  vs. compatible stimulus-response mappings across the two tasks. The fMRI analyses
  allowed for identification of distinct cognitive cost-sensitive brain regions associated
  with GSC and LSC. In fronto-parietal GSC and LSC regions, older adults' increased
  activations were associated with poorer performance (greater costs), whereas a reverse
  relationship was observed in younger adults. Older adults also recruited additional
  fronto-parietal brain regions outside the cognitive cost-sensitive areas, which
  was associated with poorer performance or no behavioral benefits. Our results suggest
  that older adults exhibit a combination of inefficient activation within cognitive
  cost-sensitive regions, specifically the GSC and LSC regions, and non-compensatory
  over-recruitment in age-sensitive regions. Age-related declines in global switching,
  compared to local switching, was observed earlier in old age at both neural and
  behavioral levels.
