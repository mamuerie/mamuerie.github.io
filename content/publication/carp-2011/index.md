abstract: 'Current theories of cognitive aging argue that neural representations become
  less distinctive in old age, a phenomenon known as dedifferentiation. The present
  study used multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to measure age differences in the
  distinctiveness of distributed patterns of neural activation evoked by different
  categories of visual images. We found that neural activation patterns within the
  ventral visual cortex were less distinctive among older adults. Further, we report
  that age differences in neural distinctiveness extend beyond the ventral visual
  cortex: older adults also showed decreased distinctiveness in early visual cortex,
  inferior parietal cortex, and medial and lateral prefrontal cortex. Neural distinctiveness
  scores in early and late visual areas were highly correlated, suggesting shared
  mechanisms of age-related decline. Finally, we investigated whether older adults
  can compensate for altered processing in visual cortex by encoding stimulus information
  across larger numbers of voxels within the visual cortex or in regions outside visual
  cortex. We found no evidence that older adults can increase the distinctiveness
  of distributed activation patterns, either within or beyond the visual cortex. Our
  results have important implications for theories of cognitive aging and highlight
  the value of MVPA to the study of neural coding in the aging brain.'
