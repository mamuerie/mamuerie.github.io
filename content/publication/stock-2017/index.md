abstract: There have recently been considerable advances in our understanding of the
  neuronal mechanisms underlying multitasking, but the role of multimodal integration
  for this faculty has remained rather unclear. We examined this issue by comparing
  different modality combinations in a multitasking (stop-change) paradigm. In-depth
  neurophysiological analyses of event-related potentials (ERPs) were conducted to
  complement the obtained behavioral data. Specifically, we applied signal decomposition
  using second order blind identification (SOBI) to the multi-subject ERP data and
  source localization. We found that both general multimodal information integration
  and modality-specific aspects (potentially related to task difficulty) modulate
  behavioral performance and associated neurophysiological correlates. Simultaneous
  multimodal input generally increased early attentional processing of visual stimuli
  (i.e. P1 and N1 amplitudes) as well as measures of cognitive effort and conflict
  (i.e. central P3 amplitudes). Yet, tactile-visual input caused larger impairments
  in multitasking than audio-visual input. General aspects of multimodal information
  integration modulated the activity in the premotor cortex (BA 6) as well as different
  visual association areas concerned with the integration of visual information with
  input from other modalities (BA 19, BA 21, BA 37). On top of this, differences in
  the specific combination of modalities also affected performance and measures of
  conflict/effort originating in prefrontal regions (BA 6).
