abstract: A recent study by Power and colleagues shows that BOLD artifacts induced
  by head movement can substantially alter patterns of resting-state functional connectivity
  and proposes a novel procedure for reducing these artifacts by deleting (or \"scrubbing\")
  movement-contaminated volumes. The authors acknowledge that this work is descriptive
  and not prescriptive, and note that future studies may refine the proposed scrubbing
  method. Nevertheless, it is worth pointing out that this method can be improved
  substantially by a single transposition in the order of operations. Temporal filtering
  is known to introduce ringing artifacts that emanate from sharp transitions in signal
  intensity. The method proposed in the target article applies temporal filtering
  before deleting contaminated volumes-in effect, spreading movement-related artifacts
  backwards and forwards in time, but deleting only the originally contaminated data.
  Using simulated data, we show that deleting and replacing contaminated volumes before
  temporal filtering removes a greater proportion of artifactual signal while retaining
  a greater proportion of the original data.
