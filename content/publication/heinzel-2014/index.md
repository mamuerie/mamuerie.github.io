abstract: In the domain of working memory (WM), a sigmoid-shaped relationship between
  WM load and brain activation patterns has been demonstrated in younger adults. It
  has been suggested that age-related alterations of this pattern are associated with
  changes in neural efficiency and capacity. At the same time, WM training studies
  have shown that some older adults are able to increase their WM performance through
  training. In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging during an n-back
  WM task at different WM load levels was applied to compare blood oxygen level-dependent
  (BOLD) responses between younger and older participants and to predict gains in
  WM performance after a subsequent 12-session WM training procedure in older adults.
  We show that increased neural efficiency and capacity, as reflected by more \"youth-like\"
  brain response patterns in regions of interest of the frontoparietal WM network,
  were associated with better behavioral training outcome beyond the effects of age,
  sex, education, gray matter volume, and baseline WM performance. Furthermore, at
  low difficulty levels, decreases in BOLD response were found after WM training.
  Results indicate that both neural efficiency (i.e., decreased activation at comparable
  performance levels) and capacity (i.e., increasing activation with increasing WM
  load) of a WM-related network predict plasticity of the WM system, whereas WM training
  may specifically increase neural efficiency in older adults.
