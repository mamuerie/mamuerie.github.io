abstract: Network neuroscience represents the brain as a collection of regions and
  inter-regional connections. Given its ability to formalize systems-level models,
  network neuroscience has generated unique explanations of neural function and behavior.
  The mechanistic status of these explanations and how they can contribute to and
  fit within the field of neuroscience as a whole has received careful treatment from
  philosophers. However, these philosophical contributions have not yet reached many
  neuroscientists. Here we complement formal philosophical efforts by providing an
  applied perspective from and for neuroscientists. We discuss the mechanistic status
  of the explanations offered by network neuroscience and how they contribute to,
  enhance, and interdigitate with other types of explanations in neuroscience. In
  doing so, we rely on philosophical work concerning the role of causality, scale,
  and mechanisms in scientific explanations. In particular, we make the distinction
  between an explanation and the evidence supporting that explanation, and we argue
  for a scale-free nature of mechanistic explanations. In the course of these discussions,
  we hope to provide a useful applied framework in which network neuroscience explanations
  can be exercised across scales and combined with other fields of neuroscience to
  gain deeper insights into the brain and behavior.
