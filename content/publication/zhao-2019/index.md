abstract: The constraints in overlapping response selection have been established
  in dual-tasking studies with random sequence of stimuli and responses as well as
  random stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA). While this approach makes it possible to
  control for advance activation of upcoming stimuli or responses, it leaves open
  whether such preparatory processing can indeed influence dual-task performance.
  We investigated whether and how the sequence of stimuli and responses and the sequence
  of SOAs can be learned and used under dual-tasking. In each trial, participants
  (N = 28 in Experiment 1 and N = 30 in Experiment 2) were first presented with a
  random two-choice task followed by a four-choice Serial Reaction Time Task (SRTT),
  presented in a sequence of length four (position sequence). The SOA (timing) sequence
  also had length four. In test phases, one or both of the sequences were randomized.
  Results showed that both position and timing sequences were learned and supported
  dual-task performance, suggesting that predictive processing with respect to timing
  and identity of stimuli and responses can help to circumvent the response selection
  bottleneck constraints. Furthermore, in contrast to previous work on acquisition
  of interval sequences in single tasking, we found that the sequence of what (i.e.
  stimulus) and the sequence of when (i.e. interval between two tasks) contributed
  independently to performance.
