abstract: OBJECTIVE  In many cases, noise in visual stimuli plays an active role in
  brain information processing. Electroencephalogram (EEG) provides an objective mean
  to measure brain cognition and information processing, and studies on the effect
  of noise on EEG can help us better understand the mechanisms involved in information
  processing.  APPROACH  In this study, visual stimuli, consisting of images with
  different noise levels, were created using the phase-scrambled method. EEG data
  evoked by these images were then obtained using the rapid serial visual presentation
  (RSVP) paradigm and the N-back method was used to induce and assess the fatigue
  state of subjects. The effect of differing noise modulation levels on EEG in different
  fatigue states was studied by analyzing the differences in the characteristics of
  steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP).  MAIN RESULTS  The study results demonstrated
  that an image's noise level had a significant impact on the evoked SSVEP characteristics.
  The amplitude and time delay of induced SSVEP were effectively enhanced by moderately
  increasing the noise of the visual stimulus images. Fatigue also appeared to affect
  SSVEP, and the difference in SSVEP characteristics induced by images with different
  noise levels decreased when the subject was fatigued.  SIGNIFICANCE  The conclusions
  of this study provide insights into the relationship between visual stimuli noise
  and SSVEP characteristics under different fatigue states. This might provide a basis
  for the study of the brain's mechanisms in regulating attention resources and the
  stochastic resonance phenomenon. In addition, this study has the potential to provide
  an objective method for rapid fatigue detection based on EEG.
