abstract: Longer lasting performance in cognitively demanding tasks leads to an exhaustion
  of cognitive resources and to a state commonly described as mental fatigue. More
  specifically, the allocation and focusing of attention become less efficient with
  time on task. Additionally, the selection of even simple responses becomes more
  error prone. With respect to the recorded EEG, mental fatigue has been reported
  to be associated with an increase in frontal theta and frontal and occipital alpha
  activity. The present study focused on the time course of changes in behavior and
  in the EEG to characterize fatigue-related processes. Participants performed a spatial
  stimulus-response-compatibility task in eight blocks for an overall duration of
  4h. Error rates increased continuously with time on task. Total alpha power was
  larger at the end compared to the beginning of the experiment. However, alpha power
  increased rapidly and reached its maximal amplitude already after 1h, whereas frontal
  theta showed a continuous increase with time on task, possibly related to increased
  effort to keep the performance level high. Time frequency analyses revealed power
  changes in the theta band induced by task relevant information that might be assigned
  to a drain of executive control capacities. Thus, frontal theta turned out to be
  a reliable marker of distinct changes in cognitive processing with increasing fatigue.
