abstract: "The study investigates the neurocognitive stages involved in the speed-accuracy
  trade-off (SAT). Contrary to previous approach, we did not manipulate speed and
  accuracy instructions: participants were required to be fast and accurate in a go/no-go
  task, and we selected post-hoc the groups based on the subjects' spontaneous behavioral
  tendency. Based on the reaction times, we selected the fast and slow groups (Speed-groups),
  and based on the percentage of false alarms, we selected the accurate and inaccurate
  groups (Accuracy-groups). The two Speed-groups were accuracy-matched, and the two
  Accuracy-groups were speed-matched. High density electroencephalographic (EEG) and
  stimulus-locked analyses allowed us to observe group differences both before and
  after the stimulus onset. Long before the stimulus appearance, the two Speed-groups
  showed different amplitude of the Bereitschaftspotential (BP), reflecting the activity
  of the supplementary motor area (SMA); by contrast, the two Accuracy-groups showed
  different amplitude of the prefrontal negativity (pN), reflecting the activity of
  the right prefrontal cortex (rPFC). In addition, the post-stimulus event-related
  potential (ERP) components showed differences between groups: the P1 component was
  larger in accurate than inaccurate group; the N1 and N2 components were larger in
  the fast than slow group; the P3 component started earlier and was larger in the
  fast than slow group. The go minus no-go subtractive wave enhancing go-related processing
  revealed a differential prefrontal positivity (dpP) that peaked at about 330 ms;
  the latency and the amplitude of this peak were associated with the speed of the
  decision process and the efficiency of the stimulus-response mapping, respectively.
  Overall, data are consistent with the view that speed and accuracy are processed
  by two interacting but separate neurocognitive systems, with different features
  in both the anticipation and the response execution phases."
