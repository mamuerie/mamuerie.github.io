abstract: Working memory (WM) span tasks-and in particular, counting span, operation
  span, and reading span tasks-are widely used measures of WM capacity. Despite their
  popularity, however, there has never been a comprehensive analysis of the merits
  of WM span tasks as measurement tools. Here, we review the genesis of these tasks
  and discuss how and why they came to be so influential. In so doing, we address
  the reliability and validity of the tasks, and we consider more technical aspects
  of the tasks, such as optimal administration and scoring procedures. Finally, we
  discuss statistical and methodological techniques that have commonly been used in
  conjunction with WM span tasks, such as latent variable analysis and extreme-groups
  designs.
