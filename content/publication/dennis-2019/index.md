abstract: Age-related deficits in associative processing are well-documented (e.g.,
  Naveh-Benjamin, 2000) and have been assumed to be the result of a general deficit
  that affects all types of binding. However, recent behavioral research has indicated
  that the visual configuration of the information that is presented to older adults
  influences the degree to which this binding deficit is exhibited by older adults
  (Overman, Dennis et al, 2019; Overman, Dennis, et al., 2018). The purpose of the
  present study was to further clarify the neural underpinnings of the associative
  deficit in aging and to examine whether functional activity at encoding differs
  with respect to the visual configuration and the type of associative being encoded.
  Using both univariate and multi-voxel pattern analysis, we found differences in
  both the magnitude of activation and pattern of neural responses associated with
  the type of association encoded (item-item and item-context). Specifically, our
  results suggest that, when controlling for stimuli composition, patterns of activation
  in sensory and frontal regions within the associative encoding network are able
  to distinguish between different types of associations. With respect to the MTL,
  multivariate results suggest that only patterns of activation in the PrC in older,
  but not younger adults, can distinguish between associations types. These findings
  extend prior work regarding the neural basis of associative memory in young and
  older adults, and extends the predictions of the binding of item and context model
  (BIC; Diana, Yonelinas, Ranganath, 2007) to older adults.
