abstract: The present study used brain imaging to determine the neural basis of individual
  differences in multitasking, the ability to successfully perform at least two attention-demanding
  tasks at once. Multitasking is mentally taxing and, therefore, should recruit the
  prefrontal cortex to maintain task goals when coordinating attentional control and
  managing the cognitive load. To investigate this possibility, we used functional
  neuroimaging to assess neural activity in both extraordinary multitaskers (Supertaskers)
  and control subjects who were matched on working memory capacity. Participants performed
  a challenging dual N-back task in which auditory and visual stimuli were presented
  simultaneously, requiring independent and continuous maintenance, updating, and
  verification of the contents of verbal and spatial working memory. With the task
  requirements and considerable cognitive load that accompanied increasing N-back,
  relative to the controls, the multitasking of Supertaskers was characterized by
  more efficient recruitment of anterior cingulate and posterior frontopolar prefrontal
  cortices. Results are interpreted using neuropsychological and evolutionary perspectives
  on individual differences in multitasking ability and the neural correlates of attentional
  control.
