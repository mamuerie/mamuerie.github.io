abstract: A fundamental issue for psychological science concerns the extent to which
  people can simultaneously perform two perceptual-motor tasks. Some theorists have
  hypothesized that such dual-task performance is severely and persistently constrained
  by a central cognitive \"bottle-neck,\" whereas others have hypothesized that skilled
  procedural decision making and response selection for two or more tasks can proceed
  at the same time under adaptive executive control. The three experiments reported
  here support this latter hypothesis. Their results show that after relatively modest
  amounts of practice, at least some participants achieve virtually perfect time sharing
  in the dual-task performance of basic choice reaction tasks. The results also show
  that observed interference between tasks can be modulated by instructions about
  differential task priorities and personal preferences for daring (concurrent) or
  cautious (successive) scheduling of tasks. Given this outcome, future research should
  investigate exactly when and how such sophisticated skills in dual-task performance
  are acquired.
