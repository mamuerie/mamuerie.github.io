abstract: Previous studies have shown that the early visual cortex contains content-specific
  representations of stimuli during visual imagery, and that these representational
  patterns of imagery content have a perceptual basis. To date, there is little evidence
  for the presence of a similar organization in the auditory and tactile domains.
  Using fMRI-based multivariate pattern analyses we showed that primary somatosensory,
  auditory, motor, and visual cortices are discriminative for imagery of touch versus
  sound. In the somatosensory, motor and visual cortices the imagery modality discriminative
  patterns were similar to perception modality discriminative patterns, suggesting
  that top-down modulations in these regions rely on similar neural representations
  as bottom-up perceptual processes. Moreover, we found evidence for content-specific
  representations of the stimuli during auditory imagery in the primary somatosensory
  and primary motor cortices. Both the imagined emotions and the imagined identities
  of the auditory stimuli could be successfully classified in these regions.
