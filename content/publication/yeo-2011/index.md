abstract: Information processing in the cerebral cortex involves interactions among
  distributed areas. Anatomical connectivity suggests that certain areas form local
  hierarchical relations such as within the visual system. Other connectivity patterns,
  particularly among association areas, suggest the presence of large-scale circuits
  without clear hierarchical relations. In this study the organization of networks
  in the human cerebrum was explored using resting-state functional connectivity MRI.
  Data from 1,000 subjects were registered using surface-based alignment. A clustering
  approach was employed to identify and replicate networks of functionally coupled
  regions across the cerebral cortex. The results revealed local networks confined
  to sensory and motor cortices as well as distributed networks of association regions.
  Within the sensory and motor cortices, functional connectivity followed topographic
  representations across adjacent areas. In association cortex, the connectivity patterns
  often showed abrupt transitions between network boundaries. Focused analyses were
  performed to better understand properties of network connectivity. A canonical sensory-motor
  pathway involving primary visual area, putative middle temporal area complex (MT+),
  lateral intraparietal area, and frontal eye field was analyzed to explore how interactions
  might arise within and between networks. Results showed that adjacent regions of
  the MT+ complex demonstrate differential connectivity consistent with a hierarchical
  pathway that spans networks. The functional connectivity of parietal and prefrontal
  association cortices was next explored. Distinct connectivity profiles of neighboring
  regions suggest they participate in distributed networks that, while showing evidence
  for interactions, are embedded within largely parallel, interdigitated circuits.
  We conclude by discussing the organization of these large-scale cerebral networks
  in relation to monkey anatomy and their potential evolutionary expansion in humans
  to support cognition.
