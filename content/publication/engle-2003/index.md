abstract: 'Publisher Summary  This chapter describes the nature of working memory
  capacity (WMC), and addresses the nature of WMC limitations, their effects on higher
  order cognitive tasks, their relationship to attention control and general fluid
  intelligence, and their neurological substrates. Much of work explores these issues
  in the context of individual differences in WMC and the cause of those individual
  differences. Measures of WMC are highly reliable and highly valid indicators of
  some construct of clear relevance to feral cognition. Macroanalytic studies have
  demonstrated that the construct reflected by WMC tasks has a strong relationship
  with gF above and beyond what these tasks share with simple span tasks. The conflict
  might also arise from stimulus representations of competing strength. This two-factor
  model fits with current thinking about the role of two brain structures: the prefrontal
  cortex as important to the maintenance of information in an active and easily accessible
  state and the anterior cingulate as important to the detection and resolution of
  conflict.'
