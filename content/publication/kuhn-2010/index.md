abstract: Voluntary action - in particular the ability to produce desired effects
  in the environment - is fundamental to human existence. According to ideomotor theory
  we can achieve goals in the environment by means of anticipating their outcomes.
  We aimed at providing neurophysiological evidence for the assumption that performing
  actions calls for the activation of brain areas associated with the sensory effects
  usually evoked by the actions. We conducted an fMRI study in which right and left
  button presses lead to the presentation of face and house pictures. We compared
  a baseline phase with the same phase after participants experienced the association
  between button presses and pictures. We found an increase in the parahippocampal
  place area (PPA) for the response that has been associated with house pictures and
  fusiform face area (FFA) for the response that has been coupled with face pictures.
  This observation constitutes support for ideomotor theory.
