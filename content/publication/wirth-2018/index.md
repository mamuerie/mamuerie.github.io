abstract: 'Actions aim to produce effects in the environment. To accomplish this properly,
  we not only have to recruit the appropriate motor patterns, but also we must be
  able to monitor whether an intended effect has ultimately been realized. Here, we
  investigated the impact of such effect monitoring on performance in multitasking
  situations: Multitasking basically means to produce and monitor multiple actions
  and effects in fast succession. We show that effect monitoring cannot run in parallel,
  without causing processing decrements, with a second task. Also, monitoring of effects
  that are spatially incompatible to a response seems to take longer than the monitoring
  of spatially compatible action effects (Experiments 1 through 4). We further argue
  that effect monitoring is essential toward learning of response-effect associations,
  as it captures not only anticipated action effects, but also unpredictable occurrences
  in the environment (Experiments 5a and 5b). (PsycINFO Database Record'
