abstract: When we produce actions we predict their likely consequences. Dominant models
  of action control suggest that these predictions are used to 'cancel' perceptual
  processing of expected outcomes. However, normative Bayesian models of sensory cognition
  developed outside of action propose that rather than being cancelled, expected sensory
  signals are represented with greater fidelity (sharpened). Here, we distinguished
  between these models in an fMRI experiment where participants executed hand actions
  (index vs little finger movement) while observing movements of an avatar hand. Consistent
  with the sharpening account, visual representations of hand movements (index vs
  little finger) could be read out more accurately when they were congruent with action
  and these decoding enhancements were accompanied by suppressed activity in voxels
  tuned away from, not towards, the expected stimulus. Therefore, inconsistent with
  dominant action control models, these data show that sensorimotor prediction sharpens
  expected sensory representations, facilitating veridical perception of action outcomes.
