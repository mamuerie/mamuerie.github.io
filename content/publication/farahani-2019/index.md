abstract: "Background: Analysis of the human connectome using functional magnetic
  resonance imaging (fMRI) started in the mid-1990s and attracted increasing attention
  in attempts to discover the neural underpinnings of human cognition and neurological
  disorders. In general, brain connectivity patterns from fMRI data are classified
  as statistical dependencies (functional connectivity) or causal interactions (effective
  connectivity) among various neural units. Computational methods, especially graph
  theory-based methods, have recently played a significant role in understanding brain
  connectivity architecture. Objectives: Thanks to the emergence of graph theoretical
  analysis, the main purpose of the current paper is to systematically review how
  brain properties can emerge through the interactions of distinct neuronal units
  in various cognitive and neurological applications using fMRI. Moreover, this article
  provides an overview of the existing functional and effective connectivity methods
  used to construct the brain network, along with their advantages and pitfalls. Methods:
  In this systematic review, the databases Science Direct, Scopus, arXiv, Google Scholar,
  IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, and SpringerLink are employed for exploring the evolution
  of computational methods in human brain connectivity from 1990 to the present, focusing
  on graph theory. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool was used to assess the risk of
  bias in individual studies. Results: Our results show that graph theory and its
  implications in cognitive neuroscience have attracted the attention of researchers
  since 2009 (as the Human Connectome Project launched), because of their prominent
  capability in characterizing the behavior of complex brain systems. Although graph
  theoretical approach can be generally applied to either functional or effective
  connectivity patterns during rest or task performance, to date, most articles have
  focused on the resting-state functional connectivity. Conclusions: This review provides
  an insight into how to utilize graph theoretical measures to make neurobiological
  inferences regarding the mechanisms underlying human cognition and behavior as well
  as different brain disorders."
