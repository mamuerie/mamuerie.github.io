abstract: Multitasking negatively influences the retention of information over brief
  periods of time. This impact of interference on working memory is exacerbated with
  normal aging. We used functional MRI to investigate the neural basis by which an
  interruption is more disruptive to working memory performance in older individuals.
  Younger and older adults engaged in delayed recognition tasks both with and without
  interruption by a secondary task. Behavioral analysis revealed that working memory
  performance was more impaired by interruptions in older compared with younger adults.
  Functional connectivity analyses showed that when interrupted, older adults disengaged
  from a memory maintenance network and reallocated attentional resources toward the
  interrupting stimulus in a manner consistent with younger adults. However, unlike
  younger individuals, older adults failed to both disengage from the interruption
  and reestablish functional connections associated with the disrupted memory network.
  These results suggest that multitasking leads to more significant working memory
  disruption in older adults because of an interruption recovery failure, manifest
  as a deficient ability to dynamically switch between functional brain networks.
