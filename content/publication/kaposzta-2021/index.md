abstract: 'Introduction: Investigating how the brain adapts to increased mental workload
  through large-scale functional reorganization appears as an important research question.
  Functional connectivity (FC) aims at capturing how disparate regions of the brain
  dynamically interact, while graph theory provides tools for the topological characterization
  of the reconstructed functional networks. Although numerous studies investigated
  how FC is altered in response to increased working memory (WM) demand, current results
  are still contradictory as few studies confirmed the robustness of these findings
  in a low-density setting. Methods: In this study, we utilized the n-back WM paradigm,
  in which subjects were presented stimuli (single digits) sequentially, and their
  task was to decide for each given stimulus if it matched the one presented n-times
  earlier. Electroencephalography recordings were performed under a control (0-back)
  and two task conditions of varying difficulty (2- and 3-back). We captured the characteristic
  connectivity patterns for each difficulty level by performing FC analysis and described
  the reconstructed functional networks with various graph theoretical measures. Results:
  We found a substantial decrease in FC when transitioning from the 0- to the 2- or
  3-back conditions, however, no differences relating to task difficulty were identified.
  The observed changes in brain network topology could be attributed to the dissociation
  of two (frontal and occipitotemporal) functional modules that were only present
  during the control condition. Furthermore, behavioral and performance measures showed
  both positive and negative correlations to connectivity indices, although only in
  the higher frequency bands. Conclusion: The marked decrease in FC may be due to
  temporarily abandoned connections that are redundant or irrelevant in solving the
  specific task. Our results indicate that FC analysis is a robust tool for investigating
  the response of the brain to increased cognitive workload.'
