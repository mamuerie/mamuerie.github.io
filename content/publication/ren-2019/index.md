abstract: Cognitive fatigue (CF) is among the most common and disturbing aging symptoms,
  and substantially interferes with activities demanding sustained mental effort.
  Here we examined the relationship between the cortical-striatal network and CF (assessed
  by the 18-item visual analogue scale) when a group of cognitively and physically
  healthy older adults participated in a 30-minute cognitively fatiguing task-related
  fMRI experiment. We also explored whether CF would interfere with the \"Posterior-Anterior
  Shifting in Aging\" (PASA) phenomenon, an aging-associated neural reliance on frontal
  regions to support cognitive capacity. We revealed that decreased connectivity strength
  of the cortical-striatal network over the course of the task was related to higher
  CF. Correlation between CF and the cortical-striatal network was more robust in
  anterior relative to posterior components. Moreover, a positive relationship between
  reliance on the anterior part of the cortical-striatal network and cognitive performance
  only existed among older adults experiencing low CF. These findings suggest a crucial
  role of the cortical-striatal network, especially the anterior component, in linking
  to CF. The PASA phenomenon may only be applicable to older adults without vulnerability
  to CF.
