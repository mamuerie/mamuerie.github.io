abstract: Traditional approaches to human information processing tend to deal with
  perception and action planning in isolation, so that an adequate account of the
  perception-action interface is still missing. On the perceptual side, the dominant
  cognitive view largely underestimates, and thus fails to account for, the impact
  of action-related processes on both the processing of perceptual information and
  on perceptual learning. On the action side, most approaches conceive of action planning
  as a mere continuation of stimulus processing, thus failing to account for the goal-directedness
  of even the simplest reaction in an experimental task. We propose a new framework
  for a more adequate theoretical treatment of perception and action planning, in
  which perceptual contents and action plans are coded in a common representational
  medium by feature codes with distal reference. Perceived events (perceptions) and
  to-be-produced events (actions) are equally represented by integrated, task-tuned
  networks of feature codes--cognitive structures we call event codes. We give an
  overview of evidence from a wide variety of empirical domains, such as spatial stimulus-response
  compatibility, sensorimotor synchronization, and ideomotor action, showing that
  our main assumptions are well supported by the data.
