abstract: Modality compatibility denotes the match between sensory stimulus modality
  and the sensory modality of the anticipated response effect (for example, vocal
  responses usually lead to auditory effects, so that auditory-vocal stimulus-response
  mappings are modality-compatible, whereas visual-vocal mappings are modality incompatible).
  In task switching studies, it has been found that switching between two modality-incompatible
  mappings (auditory-manual and visual-vocal) resulted in higher switch costs than
  switching between two modality-compatible mappings (auditory-vocal and visual-manual).
  This finding suggests that with modality-incompatible mappings, the anticipation
  of the effect of each response primes the stimulus modality linked to the competing
  task, creating task confusion. In Experiment 1, we examined whether modality-compatibility
  effects in task switching are increased by strengthening the auditory-vocal coupling
  using spatial-verbal stimuli relative to spatial-location stimuli. In Experiment
  2, we aimed at achieving the same goal by requiring temporal stimulus discrimination
  relative to spatial stimulus localisation. Results suggest that both spatial-verbal
  stimuli and temporal discrimination can increase modality-specific task interference
  through a variation of the strength of anticipation in the response-effect coupling.
  This provides further support for modality specificity of cognitive control processes
  in task switching.
