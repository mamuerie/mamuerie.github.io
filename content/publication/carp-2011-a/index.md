abstract: Recent neuroimaging studies using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) show
  that distributed patterns of brain activation elicited by different visual stimuli
  are less distinctive in older adults than in young adults. However, less is known
  about the effects of aging on the neural representation of movement. The present
  study used MVPA to compare the distinctiveness of motor representations in young
  and older adults. We also investigated the contributions of brain structure to age
  differences in the distinctiveness of motor representations. We found that neural
  distinctiveness was reduced in older adults throughout the motor control network.
  Although aging was also associated with decreased gray matter volume in these regions,
  age differences in motor distinctiveness remained significant after controlling
  for gray matter volume. Our results suggest that age-related neural dedifferentiation
  is not restricted to sensory perception and is instead a more general feature of
  the aging brain.
