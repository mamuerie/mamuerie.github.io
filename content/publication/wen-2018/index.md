abstract: Multitasking is a fundamental aspect of everyday life activities. To achieve
  a complex, multi-component goal, the tasks must be subdivided into sub-tasks and
  component steps, a critical function of prefrontal networks. The prefrontal cortex
  is considered to be organized in a cascade of executive processes from the sensorimotor
  to anterior prefrontal cortex, which includes execution of specific goal-directed
  action, to encoding and maintaining task rules, and finally monitoring distal goals.
  In the current study, we used a virtual multitasking paradigm to tap into real-world
  performance and relate it to each individual's resting-state functional connectivity
  in fMRI. While did not find any correlation between global connectivity of any of
  the major networks with multitasking ability, global connectivity of the lateral
  prefrontal cortex (LPFC) was predictive of multitasking ability. Further analysis
  showed that multivariate connectivity patterns within the sensorimotor network (SMN),
  and between-network connectivity of the frontoparietal network (FPN) and dorsal
  attention network (DAN), predicted individual multitasking ability and could be
  generalized to novel individuals. Together, these results support previous research
  that prefrontal networks underlie multitasking abilities and show that connectivity
  patterns in the cascade of prefrontal networks may explain individual differences
  in performance.
