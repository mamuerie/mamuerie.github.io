abstract: UNLABELLED  The human brain is able to exceed modern computers on multiple
  computational demands (e.g., language, planning) using a small fraction of the energy.
  The mystery of how the brain can be so efficient is compounded by recent evidence
  that all brain regions are constantly active as they interact in so-called resting-state
  networks (RSNs). To investigate the brain's ability to process complex cognitive
  demands efficiently, we compared functional connectivity (FC) during rest and multiple
  highly distinct tasks. We found previously that RSNs are present during a wide variety
  of tasks and that tasks only minimally modify FC patterns throughout the brain.
  Here, we tested the hypothesis that, although subtle, these task-evoked FC updates
  from rest nonetheless contribute strongly to behavioral performance. One might expect
  that larger changes in FC reflect optimization of networks for the task at hand,
  improving behavioral performance. Alternatively, smaller changes in FC could reflect
  optimization for efficient (i.e., small) network updates, reducing processing demands
  to improve behavioral performance. We found across three task domains that high-performing
  individuals exhibited more efficient brain connectivity updates in the form of smaller
  changes in functional network architecture between rest and task. These smaller
  changes suggest that individuals with an optimized intrinsic network configuration
  for domain-general task performance experience more efficient network updates generally.
  Confirming this, network update efficiency correlated with general intelligence.
  The brain's reconfiguration efficiency therefore appears to be a key feature contributing
  to both its network dynamics and general cognitive ability.  SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT  The
  brain's network configuration varies based on current task demands. For example,
  functional brain connections are organized in one way when one is resting quietly
  but in another way if one is asked to make a decision. We found that the efficiency
  of these updates in brain network organization is positively related to general
  intelligence, the ability to perform a wide variety of cognitively challenging tasks
  well. Specifically, we found that brain network configuration at rest was already
  closer to a wide variety of task configurations in intelligent individuals. This
  suggests that the ability to modify network connectivity efficiently when task demands
  change is a hallmark of high intelligence.
