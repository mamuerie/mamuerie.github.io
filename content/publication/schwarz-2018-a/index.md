abstract: Anticipated action effects have been shown to govern action selection and
  initiation, as described in ideomotor theory, and they have also been demonstrated
  to determine crosstalk between different tasks in multitasking studies. Such effect-based
  crosstalk was observed not only in a forward manner (with a first task influencing
  performance in a following second task) but also in a backward manner (the second
  task influencing the preceding first task), suggesting that action effect codes
  can become activated prior to a capacity-limited processing stage often denoted
  as response selection. The process of effect-based response production, by contrast,
  has been proposed to be capacity-limited. These observations jointly suggest that
  effect code activation can occur independently of effect-based response production,
  though this theoretical implication has not been tested directly at present. We
  tested this hypothesis by employing a dual-task set-up in which we manipulated the
  ease of effect-based response production (via response-effect compatibility) in
  an experimental design that allows for observing forward and backward crosstalk.
  We observed robust crosstalk effects and response-effect compatibility effects alike,
  but no interaction between both effects. These results indicate that effect activation
  can occur in parallel for several tasks, independently of effect-based response
  production, which is confined to one task at a time.
