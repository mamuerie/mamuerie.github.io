abstract: The study of the concurrent performance of two tasks allows deep insights
  into the human cognitive system and, accordingly, an increasing number of brain
  imaging studies are conducted to identify the neuroanatomical correlates of such
  dual-task performance. In this overview we present currently used approaches to
  identify dual-task-specific activations in fMRI and PET studies. A comparison is
  made in order to identify the approaches which have the potential to validly detect
  dual-task-specific activation patterns, i.e. activation which cannot be explained
  by the individual performance of the component tasks alone. We demonstrate that
  while all approaches suffer from at least some drawbacks, the best (although potentially
  over-conservative) approach is to compare the dual task with the sum of the single
  tasks, the second-best is an interaction contrast, and the third-best a conjunction
  analysis. Comparisons of the dual task with the mean of single-task activity or
  with only one single task should be avoided except for a few specific situations.
  We generalize our conclusions to related research areas, such as multisensory integration
  or divided attention.
