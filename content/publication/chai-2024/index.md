abstract: A key element of human flexible behavior concerns the ability to continuously
  predict and prepare for sudden changes in tasks or actions. Here, we tested whether
  people can dynamically modulate task preparation processes and decision-making strategies
  when the identity of a to-be-performed task becomes uncertain. To this end, we developed
  a new paradigm where participants need to prepare for one of nine tasks on each
  trial. Crucially, in some blocks, the task being prepared could suddenly shift to
  a different task after a longer cue-target interval, by changing either the stimulus
  category or categorization rule that defined the initial task. We found that participants
  were able to dynamically modulate task preparation in the face of this task uncertainty.
  A second experiment shows that these changes in behavior were not simply a function
  of decreasing task expectancy, but rather of increasing switch expectancy. Finally,
  in the third and fourth experiment, we demonstrate that these dynamic modulations
  can be applied in a compositional manner, depending on whether either only the stimulus
  category or categorization rule would be expected to switch.
