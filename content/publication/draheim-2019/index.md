abstract: Reaction time is believed to be a good indicator of the speed and efficiency
  of mental processes and is a ubiquitous variable in the behavioral sciences. Despite
  this popularity, there are numerous issues associated with using reaction time (RT),
  specifically in differential and developmental research. Here, we identify and focus
  on two main problems-unreliability and sensitivity to speed-accuracy interactions.
  The use of difference scores is a primary factor that leads to many RT measures
  having demonstrably low reliability, and RT measures in general often do not properly
  account for speed-accuracy interactions. Both factors jeopardize the validity and
  interpretability of results based on RT. Here, we evaluate conceptually and empirically
  how these issues affect individual differences research. Although the empirical
  evidence we provide are primarily within the domains of attention control and task
  switching, we highlight examples from various other areas of psychological inquiry.
  We also discuss many of the statistical and methodological alternatives available
  to researchers conducting correlational studies. Ultimately, we encourage researchers
  comparing individuals of differing cognitive and developmental levels to strongly
  consider using these alternatives in lieu of RT, specifically RT difference scores.
