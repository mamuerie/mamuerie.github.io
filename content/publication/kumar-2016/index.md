abstract: 'UNLABELLED  The brain basis for auditory working memory, the process of
  actively maintaining sounds in memory over short periods of time, is controversial.
  Using functional magnetic resonance imaging in human participants, we demonstrate
  that the maintenance of single tones in memory is associated with activation in
  auditory cortex. In addition, sustained activation was observed in hippocampus and
  inferior frontal gyrus. Multivoxel pattern analysis showed that patterns of activity
  in auditory cortex and left inferior frontal gyrus distinguished the tone that was
  maintained in memory. Functional connectivity during maintenance was demonstrated
  between auditory cortex and both the hippocampus and inferior frontal cortex. The
  data support a system for auditory working memory based on the maintenance of sound-specific
  representations in auditory cortex by projections from higher-order areas, including
  the hippocampus and frontal cortex.  SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT  In this work, we demonstrate
  a system for maintaining sound in working memory based on activity in auditory cortex,
  hippocampus, and frontal cortex, and functional connectivity among them. Specifically,
  our work makes three advances from the previous work. First, we robustly demonstrate
  hippocampal involvement in all phases of auditory working memory (encoding, maintenance,
  and retrieval): the role of hippocampus in working memory is controversial. Second,
  using a pattern classification technique, we show that activity in the auditory
  cortex and inferior frontal gyrus is specific to the maintained tones in working
  memory. Third, we show long-range connectivity of auditory cortex to hippocampus
  and frontal cortex, which may be responsible for keeping such representations active
  during working memory maintenance.'
