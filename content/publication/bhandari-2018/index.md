abstract: The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is central to flexible, goal-directed cognition,
  and understanding its representational code is an important problem in cognitive
  neuroscience. In humans, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of fMRI blood oxygenation
  level-dependent (BOLD) measurements has emerged as an important approach for studying
  neural representations. Many previous studies have implicitly assumed that MVPA
  of fMRI BOLD is just as effective in decoding information encoded in PFC neural
  activity as it is in visual cortex. However, MVPA studies of PFC have had mixed
  success. Here we estimate the base rate of decoding information from PFC BOLD activity
  patterns from a meta-analysis of published MVPA studies. We show that PFC has a
  significantly lower base rate (55.4%) than visual areas in occipital (66.6%) and
  temporal (71.0%) cortices and one that is close to chance levels. Our results have
  implications for the design and interpretation of MVPA studies of PFC and raise
  important questions about its functional organization.
