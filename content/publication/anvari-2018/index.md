abstract: Replication failures of past findings in several scientific disciplines,
  including psychology, medicine, and experimental economics, have created a “crisis
  of confidence” among scientists. Psychological science has been at the forefront
  of tackling these issues, with discussions about replication failures and scientific
  self-criticisms of questionable research practices (QRPs) increasingly taking place
  in public forums. How this replicability crisis impacts the public’s trust is a
  question yet to be answered by research. Whereas some researchers believe that the
  public’s trust will be positively impacted or maintained, others believe trust will
  be diminished. Because it is our field of expertise, we focus on trust in psychological
  science. We performed a study testing how public trust in past and future psychological
  research would be impacted by being informed about (i) replication failures (replications
  group), (ii) replication failures and criticisms of QRPs (QRPs group), and (iii)
  replication failures, criticisms of QRPs, and proposed reforms (reforms group).
  Results from a mostly European sample (N~=~1129) showed that, compared to a control
  group, people in the replications, QRPs, and reforms groups self-reported less trust
  in past research. Regarding trust in future research, the replications and QRPs
  groups did not significantly differ from the control group. Surprisingly, the reforms
  group had less trust in future research than the control group. Nevertheless, people
  in the replications, QRPs, and reforms groups did not significantly differ from
  the control group in how much they believed future research in psychological science
  should be supported by public funding. Potential explanations are discussed.
