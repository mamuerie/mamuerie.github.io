abstract: In this study, a combined measure was developed based on various physiological
  indices in order to evaluate the mental workload during a dual task. To determine
  the mental effort required for each task, three physiological signals were recorded
  while ten subjects performed different versions of a dual task composed of tracking
  and mental arithmetic. These signals were the electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram
  (EOG), and electrocardiogram (ECG), which were transformed into the suppression
  of alpha rhythm, eye blink interval, and heart rate variability (HRV), respectively.
  The alpha suppression provided proper information to infer the efforts for the arithmetic
  task, but not for the tracking task. Conversely, the blink interval and HRV permitted
  detailed inferences over the workload of the tracking task, but not for the arithmetic
  task. These results can be explained in terms of the multiple resources model of
  workload. The processing indexed by the alpha suppression is inferred to be different
  from that indexed by the blink interval or HRV. Finally, the physiological measures
  were combined into a single measure using different weight coefficients. The newly
  developed measure systematically increased with the difficulty of each task and
  significantly distinguished between the different versions of each task.
