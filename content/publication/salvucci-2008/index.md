abstract: The authors propose the idea of threaded cognition, an integrated theory
  of concurrent multitasking--that is, performing 2 or more tasks at once. Threaded
  cognition posits that streams of thought can be represented as threads of processing
  coordinated by a serial procedural resource and executed across other available
  resources (e.g., perceptual and motor resources). The theory specifies a parsimonious
  mechanism that allows for concurrent execution, resource acquisition, and resolution
  of resource conflicts, without the need for specialized executive processes. By
  instantiating this mechanism as a computational model, threaded cognition provides
  explicit predictions of how multitasking behavior can result in interference, or
  lack thereof, for a given set of tasks. The authors illustrate the theory in model
  simulations of several representative domains ranging from simple laboratory tasks
  such as dual-choice tasks to complex real-world domains such as driving and driver
  distraction.
