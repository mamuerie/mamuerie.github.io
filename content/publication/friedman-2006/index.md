abstract: Accumulating evidence suggests that executive functions (EFs) are related
  to intelligence, despite neuropsychological results initially considered evidence
  of no such relation. However, findings that EFs are not unitary raise the issue
  of how intelligence relates to different EFs. This study examined the relations
  of fluid and crystallized intelligence and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IQ
  to three separable EFs--inhibiting prepotent responses (inhibiting), shifting mental
  sets (shifting), and updating working memory (updating)--in young adults. Updating
  was highly correlated with the intelligence measures, but inhibiting and shifting
  were not. Furthermore, in structural equation models controlling for the inter-EF
  correlations, updating remained strongly related to intelligence, but the relations
  of inhibiting and shifting to intelligence were small and not significant. The results
  indicate that intelligence measures differentially relate to these three EFs, suggesting
  that current intelligence measures do not equally assess a wide range of executive
  control abilities likely required for many \"intelligent\" behaviors.
