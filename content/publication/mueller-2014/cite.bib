 abstract = {BACKGROUND We briefly describe the Psychology Experiment Building Language (PEBL), an open source software system for designing and running psychological experiments. NEW METHOD We describe the PEBL Test Battery, a set of approximately 70 behavioral tests which can be freely used, shared, and modified. Included is a comprehensive set of past research upon which tests in the battery are based. RESULTS We report the results of benchmark tests that establish the timing precision of PEBL. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD We consider alternatives to the PEBL system and battery tests. CONCLUSIONS We conclude with a discussion of the ethical factors involved in the open source testing movement.},
