abstract: Brain mechanisms of error processing have often been investigated using
  response interference tasks and focusing on the posterior medial frontal cortex,
  which is also implicated in resolving response conflict in general. Thereby, the
  role other brain regions may play has remained undervalued. Here, activation likelihood
  estimation meta-analyses were used to synthesize the neuroimaging literature on
  brain activity related to committing errors versus responding successfully in interference
  tasks and to test for commonalities and differences. The salience network and the
  temporoparietal junction were commonly recruited irrespective of whether responses
  were correct or incorrect, pointing towards a general involvement in coping with
  situations that call for increased cognitive control. The dorsal posterior cingulate
  cortex, posterior thalamus, and left superior frontal gyrus showed error-specific
  convergence, which underscores their consistent involvement when performance goals
  are not met. In contrast, successful responding revealed stronger convergence in
  the dorsal attention network and lateral prefrontal regions. Underrecruiting these
  regions in error trials may reflect failures in activating the task-appropriate
  stimulus-response contingencies necessary for successful response execution.
