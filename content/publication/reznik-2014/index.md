abstract: Performing actions with auditory consequences modulates the response in
  auditory cortex to otherwise identical stimuli passively heard. Such modulation
  has been suggested to occur through a corollary discharge sent from the motor cortex
  during voluntary actions. However, the relationship between the effector used to
  generate the sound, type of modulation and changes in perceptual sensitivity are
  unclear. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging on healthy subjects and
  demonstrate bilateral enhancement in the auditory cortex to self-generated versus
  externally generated sounds. Furthermore, we find that this enhancement is stronger
  when the sound-producing hand is contralateral to the auditory cortex. At the behavioural
  level, binaural hearing thresholds are lower for self-generated sounds and monaural
  thresholds are lower for sounds triggered by the hand ipsilateral to the stimulated
  ear. Together with functional connectivity analysis, our results suggest that a
  corollary discharge sent from active motor cortex enhances activity in the auditory
  cortex and increases perceptual sensitivity in a lateralized manner.
