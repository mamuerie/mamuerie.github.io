abstract: Past research has consistently found that people are likely to do worse
  on high-level cognitive tasks after exerting self-control on previous actions. However,
  little has been unraveled about to what extent ego depletion affects subsequent
  prospective memory. Drawing upon the self-control strength model and the relationship
  between self-control resources and executive control, this study proposes that the
  initial actions of self-control may undermine subsequent event-based prospective
  memory (EBPM). Ego depletion was manipulated through watching a video requiring
  visual attention (Experiment 1) or completing an incongruent Stroop task (Experiment
  2). Participants were then tested on EBPM embedded in an ongoing task. As predicted,
  the results showed that after ruling out possible intervening variables (e.g. mood,
  focal and nonfocal cues, and characteristics of ongoing task and ego depletion task),
  participants in the high-depletion condition performed significantly worse on EBPM
  than those in the low-depletion condition. The results suggested that the effect
  of ego depletion on EBPM was mainly due to an impaired prospective component rather
  than to a retrospective component.
