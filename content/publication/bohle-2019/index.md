abstract: The concurrent performance of cognitive and postural tasks is particularly
  impaired in old adults and associated with an increased risk of falls. Biological
  aging of the cognitive and postural control system appears to be responsible for
  increased cognitive-motor interference effects. We examined neural and behavioral
  markers of motor-cognitive dual-task performance in young and old adults performing
  spatial one-back working memory single and dual tasks during semitandem stance.
  On the neural level, we used EEG to test for age-related modulations in the frequency
  domain related to cognitive-postural task load. Twenty-eight healthy young and 30
  old adults participated in this study. The tasks included a postural single task,
  a cognitive-postural dual task, and a cognitive-postural triple task (cognitive
  dual-task with postural demands). Postural sway (i.e., total center of pressure
  displacements) was recorded in semistance position on an unstable surface that was
  placed on top of a force plate while performing cognitive tasks. Neural activation
  was recorded using a 64-channel mobile EEG system. EEG frequencies were attenuated
  by the baseline postural single-task condition and demarcated in nine Regions-of-Interest
  (ROIs), i.e., anterior, central, posterior, over the cortical midline, and both
  hemispheres. Our findings revealed impaired cognitive dual-task performance in old
  compared to young participants in the form of significantly lower cognitive performance
  in the triple-task condition. Furthermore, old adults compared with young adults
  showed significantly larger postural sway, especially in cognitive-postural task
  conditions. With respect to EEG frequencies, young compared to old participants
  showed significantly lower alpha-band activity in cognitive-cognitive-postural triple-task
  conditions compared with cognitive-postural dual tasks. In addition, with increasing
  task difficulty, we observed synchronized theta and delta frequencies, irrespective
  of age. Task-dependent alterations of the alpha frequency band were most pronounced
  over frontal and central ROIs, while alterations of the theta and delta frequency
  bands were found in frontal, central, and posterior ROIs. Theta and delta synchronization
  exhibited a decrease from anterior to posterior regions. For old adults, task difficulty
  was reflected by theta synchronization in the posterior ROI. For young adults, it
  was reflected by alpha desynchronization in bilateral anterior ROIs. In addition,
  we could not identify any effects of task difficulty and age on the beta frequency
  band. Our results shed light on age-related cognitive and postural declines and
  how they interact. Modulated alpha frequencies during high cognitive-postural task
  demands in young but not old adults might be reflective of a constrained neural
  adaptive potential in old adults. Future studies are needed to elucidate associations
  between the identified age-related performance decrements with task difficulty and
  changes in brain activity.
