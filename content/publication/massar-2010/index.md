abstract: Mental fatigue has a wide range of effects on cognitive, behavioral, and
  motivational measures. It can be expected that specific effects in which fatigue
  becomes manifest is dependent on the nature of fatigue-inducing activity (e.g.,
  level of control and working memory demands). This study examined how fatigue caused
  by tasks that differ on the level of working memory demands (0-Back, 2-Back) affects
  brain function (novelty processing, P3a) and performance (driving). Results showed
  that fatigue did not affect driving performance. Fatigue did reduce P3a amplitude,
  but only after 2-Back. P3a was also reduced during driving. The effects of fatigue
  and driving on P3a were additive. In summary, both driving and fatigue reduced P3a
  amplitude. Driving effects were always present. Fatigue effects on novelty processing
  were dependent on the cognitive demands of the fatigue-inducing task.
