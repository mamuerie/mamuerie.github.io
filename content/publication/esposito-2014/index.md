abstract: Brain activity during rest is spatially coherent over functional connectivity
  networks called resting-state networks. In resting-state functional magnetic resonance
  imaging, independent component analysis yields spatially distributed network representations
  reflecting distinct mental processes, such as intrinsic (default) or extrinsic (executive)
  attention, and sensory inhibition or excitation. These aspects can be related to
  different treatments or subjective experiences. Among these, exhaustion is a common
  psychological state induced by prolonged mental performance. Using repeated functional
  magnetic resonance imaging sessions and spatial independent component analysis,
  we explored the effect of several hours of sustained cognitive performances on the
  resting human brain. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed
  on the same healthy volunteers in two days, with and without, and before, during
  and after, an intensive psychological treatment (skill training and sustained practice
  with a flight simulator). After each scan, subjects rated their level of exhaustion
  and performed an N-back task to evaluate eventual decrease in cognitive performance.
  Spatial maps of selected resting-state network components were statistically evaluated
  across time points to detect possible changes induced by the sustained mental performance.
  The intensive treatment had a significant effect on exhaustion and effort ratings,
  but no effects on N-back performances. Significant changes in the most exhausted
  state were observed in the early visual processing and the anterior default mode
  networks (enhancement) and in the fronto-parietal executive networks (suppression),
  suggesting that mental exhaustion is associated with a more idling brain state and
  that internal attention processes are facilitated to the detriment of more extrinsic
  processes. The described application may inspire future indicators of the level
  of fatigue in the neural attention system.
