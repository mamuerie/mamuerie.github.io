abstract: The prefrontal cortex has long been suspected to play an important role
  in cognitive control, in the ability to orchestrate thought and action in accordance
  with internal goals. Its neural basis, however, has remained a mystery. Here, we
  propose that cognitive control stems from the active maintenance of patterns of
  activity in the prefrontal cortex that represent goals and the means to achieve
  them. They provide bias signals to other brain structures whose net effect is to
  guide the flow of activity along neural pathways that establish the proper mappings
  between inputs, internal states, and outputs needed to perform a given task. We
  review neurophysiological, neurobiological, neuroimaging, and computational studies
  that support this theory and discuss its implications as well as further issues
  to be addressed
