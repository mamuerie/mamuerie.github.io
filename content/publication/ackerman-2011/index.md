abstract: '\"This book is based on a 3-day conference held at the Georgia Institute
  of Technology, Atlanta, in May 2009. The 14 invited chapter authors represent six
  countries and various university, government, and organizational laboratories. This
  book offers a contemporary panoramic snapshot of the field of cognitive fatigue
  research and applications. A wide array of theories and experimental methods are
  described, from mean effects to the study of individual differences and team performance,
  as are a variety of fatigue-related phenomena, ranging from neuroscience studies
  to examinations of laboratory and real-world behaviors and subjective feelings.
  The discussion sections after each chapter and in the last section of the book provide
  a rare glimpse into common and unique sources of theoretical and empirical progress
  in the field--the paradigm clashes and the points of common understanding that transcend
  this multidisciplinary field. The richness of the discussion reflects how the science
  progresses through challenges and disagreements, and also how scientists integrate
  research across areas to build more robust representations of empirical phenomena
  and search for new paradigms in which theories can be tested and generalized. Together,
  these chapters illustrate how much progress has been made in the field of cognitive
  fatigue, and they provide important sources of inspiration for future research and
  applications in the field\"--Introduction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA,
