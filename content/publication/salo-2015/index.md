abstract: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate brain activations
  during nine different dual tasks in which the participants were required to simultaneously
  attend to concurrent streams of spoken syllables and written letters. They performed
  a phonological, spatial or \"simple\" (speaker-gender or font-shade) discrimination
  task within each modality. We expected to find activations associated specifically
  with dual tasking especially in the frontal and parietal cortices. However, no brain
  areas showed systematic dual task enhancements common for all dual tasks. Further
  analysis revealed that dual tasks including component tasks that were according
  to Baddeley's model \"modality atypical,\" that is, the auditory spatial task or
  the visual phonological task, were not associated with enhanced frontal activity.
  In contrast, for other dual tasks, activity specifically associated with dual tasking
  was found in the left or bilateral frontal cortices. Enhanced activation in parietal
  areas, however, appeared not to be specifically associated with dual tasking per
  se, but rather with intermodal attention switching. We also expected effects of
  dual tasking in left frontal supramodal phonological processing areas when both
  component tasks required phonological processing and in right parietal supramodal
  spatial processing areas when both tasks required spatial processing. However, no
  such effects were found during these dual tasks compared with their component tasks
  performed separately. Taken together, the current results indicate that activations
  during dual tasks depend in a complex manner on specific demands of component tasks.
