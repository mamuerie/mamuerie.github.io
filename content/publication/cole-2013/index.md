abstract: "Extensive evidence suggests that the human ability to adaptively implement
  a wide variety of tasks is preferentially a result of the operation of a fronto-parietal
  brain network (FPN). We hypothesized that this network's adaptability is made possible
  by flexible hubs: brain regions that rapidly update their pattern of global functional
  connectivity according to task demands. Using recent advances in characterizing
  brain network organization and dynamics, we identified mechanisms consistent with
  the flexible hub theory. We found that the FPN's brain-wide functional connectivity
  pattern shifted more than those of other networks across a variety of task states
  and that these connectivity patterns could be used to identify the current task.
  Furthermore, these patterns were consistent across practiced and novel tasks, suggesting
  that reuse of flexible hub connectivity patterns facilitates adaptive (novel) task
  performance. Together, these findings support a central role for fronto-parietal
  flexible hubs in cognitive control and adaptive implementation of task demands."
