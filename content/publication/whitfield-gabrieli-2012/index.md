abstract: Resting state functional connectivity reveals intrinsic, spontaneous networks
  that elucidate the functional architecture of the human brain. However, valid statistical
  analysis used to identify such networks must address sources of noise in order to
  avoid possible confounds such as spurious correlations based on non-neuronal sources.
  We have developed a functional connectivity toolbox Conn ( www.nitrc.org/projects/conn
  ) that implements the component-based noise correction method (CompCor) strategy
  for physiological and other noise source reduction, additional removal of movement,
  and temporal covariates, temporal filtering and windowing of the residual blood
  oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast signal, first-level estimation of multiple
  standard functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) measures, and
  second-level random-effect analysis for resting state as well as task-related data.
  Compared to methods that rely on global signal regression, the CompCor noise reduction
  method allows for interpretation of anticorrelations as there is no regression of
  the global signal. The toolbox implements fcMRI measures, such as estimation of
  seed-to-voxel and region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI functional correlations, as well
  as semipartial correlation and bivariate/multivariate regression analysis for multiple
  ROI sources, graph theoretical analysis, and novel voxel-to-voxel analysis of functional
  connectivity. We describe the methods implemented in the Conn toolbox for the analysis
  of fcMRI data, together with examples of use and interscan reliability estimates
  of all the implemented fcMRI measures. The results indicate that the CompCor method
  increases the sensitivity and selectivity of fcMRI analysis, and show a high degree
  of interscan reliability for many fcMRI measures.
