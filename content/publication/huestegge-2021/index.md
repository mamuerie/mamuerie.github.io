abstract: The present study asks how behavioral (dual-action) demands in dual tasks
  are mentally represented and whether changes in representation might govern practice-related
  dual-task performance improvements. Three different representation accounts were
  empirically tested based on the idea that dual-action demands required in a dual-task
  trial might be represented in different ways. According to a compositional (Structuralist)
  account, component tasks remain structurally intact when combined with another task.
  In contrast, a holistic (Gestalt) account posits that dual-action requirements in
  dual tasks are represented holistically and entirely distinct from its component
  action requirements. Finally, a contextual change account assumes that a change
  in context (e.g., from single- to dual-action requirement) generally impedes response
  retrieval, similar to repeating a response while the task context switches. To address
  this issue, we analyzed trial-by-trial effects in a single/dual switch paradigm
  (SDS paradigm, involving a randomized mix of single- and dual-task trials within
  blocks). Specifically, we analyzed performance in an extensive dual-task training
  setting (involving training sessions across several days) combining an auditory-vocal
  task and a visual-manual task. The results indicated that, throughout practice,
  nearly all relevant comparisons of performance between complete switch trials (e.g.,
  between the two single tasks) and partial repetition trials (e.g., from dual to
  single task) revealed partial repetition benefits, that is, for both the auditory-vocal
  and the visual-manual task, and for both single- and dual-task performance analyses.
  Therefore, dual-action requirements in the present dual-task setting are mentally
  represented in a compositional, Structuralist fashion, probably due to low between-task
  dimensional overlap.
