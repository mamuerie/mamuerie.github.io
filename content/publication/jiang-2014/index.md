abstract: Resolving conflicting sensory and motor representations is a core function
  of cognitive control, but it remains uncertain to what degree control over different
  sources of conflict is implemented by shared (domain general) or distinct (domain
  specific) neural resources. Behavioral data suggest conflict-control to be domain
  specific, but results from neuroimaging studies have been ambivalent. Here, we employed
  multivoxel pattern analyses that can decode a brain region's informational content,
  allowing us to distinguish incidental activation overlap from actual shared information
  processing. We trained independent sets of \"searchlight\" classifiers on functional
  magnetic resonance imaging data to decode control processes associated with stimulus-conflict
  (Stroop task) and ideomotor-conflict (Simon task). Quantifying the proportion of
  domain-specific searchlights (capable of decoding only one type of conflict) and
  domain-general searchlights (capable of decoding both conflict types) in each subject,
  we found both domain-specific and domain-general searchlights, though the former
  were more common. When mapping anatomical loci of these searchlights across subjects,
  neural substrates of stimulus- and ideomotor-specific conflict-control were found
  to be anatomically consistent across subjects, whereas the substrates of domain-general
  conflict-control were not. Overall, these findings suggest a hybrid neural architecture
  of conflict-control that entails both modular (domain specific) and global (domain
  general) components.
