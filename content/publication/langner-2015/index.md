abstract: Healthy aging has been found associated with less efficient response conflict
  solution, but the cognitive and neural mechanisms remain elusive. In a two-experiment
  study, we first examined the behavioural consequences of this putative age-related
  decline for conflicts induced by spatial stimulus–response incompatibility. We then
  used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a large, independent
  sample of adults (n = 399; 18–85 years) to investigate age differences in functional
  connectivity between the nodes of a network previously found associated with incompatibility-induced
  response conflicts in the very same paradigm. As expected, overcoming interference
  from conflicting response tendencies took longer in older adults, even after accounting
  for potential mediator variables (general response speed and accuracy, motor speed,
  visuomotor coordination ability, and cognitive flexibility). Experiment 2 revealed
  selective age-related decreases in functional connectivity between bilateral anterior
  insula, presupplementary motor area, and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Importantly,
  these age effects persisted after controlling for regional gray-matter atrophy assessed
  by voxel-based morphometry. Meta-analytic functional profiling using the BrainMap
  database showed these age-sensitive nodes to be more strongly linked to highly abstract
  cognition, as compared with the remaining network nodes, which in turn were more
  strongly linked to action-related processing. These findings indicate changes in
  interregional coupling with age among task-relevant network nodes that are not specifically
  associated with conflict resolution per se. Rather, our behavioural and neural data
  jointly suggest that healthy aging is associated with difficulties in properly activating
  nondominant but relevant task schemata necessary to exert efficient cognitive control
  over action.
