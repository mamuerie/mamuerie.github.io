abstract: As indicated by previous research, aging is associated with a decline in
  working memory (WM) functioning, related to alterations in fronto-parietal neural
  activations. At the same time, previous studies showed that WM training in older
  adults may improve the performance in the trained task (training effect), and more
  importantly, also in untrained WM tasks (transfer effects). However, neural correlates
  of these transfer effects that would improve understanding of its underlying mechanisms,
  have not been shown in older participants as yet. In this study, we investigated
  blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes during n-back performance and
  an untrained delayed recognition (Sternberg) task following 12sessions (45min each)
  of adaptive n-back training in older adults. The Sternberg task used in this study
  allowed to test for neural training effects independent of specific task affordances
  of the trained task and to separate maintenance from updating processes. Thirty-two
  healthy older participants (60-75years) were assigned either to an n-back training
  or a no-contact control group. Before (t1) and after (t2) training/waiting period,
  both the n-back task and the Sternberg task were conducted while BOLD signal was
  measured using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in all participants.
  In addition, neuropsychological tests were performed outside the scanner. WM performance
  improved with training and behavioral transfer to tests measuring executive functions,
  processing speed, and fluid intelligence was found. In the training group, BOLD
  signal in the right lateral middle frontal gyrus/caudal superior frontal sulcus
  (Brodmann area, BA 6/8) decreased in both the trained n-back and the updating condition
  of the untrained Sternberg task at t2, compared to the control group. fMRI findings
  indicate a training-related increase in processing efficiency of WM networks, potentially
  related to the process of WM updating. Performance gains in untrained tasks suggest
  that transfer to other cognitive tasks remains possible in aging.
