abstract: Crossmodal selective attention was investigated in a cued task switching
  paradigm using bimodal visual and auditory stimulation. A cue indicated the imperative
  modality. Three levels of spatial S-R associations were established following perceptual
  (location), structural (numerical), and conceptual (verbal) set-level compatibility.
  In Experiment 1, participants switched attention between the auditory and visual
  modality either with a spatial-location or spatial-numerical stimulus set. In the
  spatial-location set, participants performed a localization judgment on left vs.
  right presented stimuli, whereas the spatial-numerical set required a magnitude
  judgment about a visually or auditorily presented number word. Single-modality blocks
  with unimodal stimuli were included as a control condition. In Experiment 2, the
  spatial-numerical stimulus set was replaced by a spatial-verbal stimulus set using
  direction words (e.g., \"left\"). RT data showed modality switch costs, which were
  asymmetric across modalities in the spatial-numerical and spatial-verbal stimulus
  set (i.e., larger for auditory than for visual stimuli), and congruency effects,
  which were asymmetric primarily in the spatial-location stimulus set (i.e., larger
  for auditory than for visual stimuli). This pattern of effects suggests task-dependent
  visual dominance.
