abstract: Humans are remarkably efficient at adapting to different contextual demands
  by exerting optimal levels of cognitive flexibility versus stability for switching
  between different tasks. Here, we show how a recurrent neural network can be used
  to simulate behavioral indices of cognitive flexibility versus stability, and investigate
  how people learn and apply optimal control settings across different contexts. Our
  model showed both fast but transient adaptation (in activation space) to high- versus
  low-switch frequency conditions, and slow but more enduring shallow versus deep
  task attractor settings (in weight space) in these same contexts. Interestingly,
  it further learned to associate and use information from its context to different
  task attractor settings and shift along a flexibility-stability continuum. In sum,
  we provide a novel framework that sheds new light on classic measures of cognitive
  flexibility versus stability when people must switch between several tasks, through
  the lens of activation-based versus weight-based adaptations.
