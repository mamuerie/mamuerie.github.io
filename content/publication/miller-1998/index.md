abstract: A new method based on jackknifing is presented for measuring the difference
  between two conditions in the onset latencies of the lateralized readiness potential
  (LRP). The method can be used with both stimulus- and response-locked LRPs, and
  simulations indicate that it provides accurate estimates of onset latency differences
  in many common experimental conditions.
