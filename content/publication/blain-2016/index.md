abstract: The ability to exert self-control is key to social insertion and professional
  success. An influential literature in psychology has developed the theory that self-control
  relies on a limited common resource, so that fatigue effects might carry over from
  one task to the next. However, the biological nature of the putative limited resource
  and the existence of carry-over effects have been matters of considerable controversy.
  Here, we targeted the activity of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) as a common
  substrate for cognitive control, and we prolonged the time scale of fatigue induction
  by an order of magnitude. Participants performed executive control tasks known to
  recruit the LPFC (working memory and task-switching) over more than 6 h (an approximate
  workday). Fatigue effects were probed regularly by measuring impulsivity in intertemporal
  choices, i.e., the propensity to favor immediate rewards, which has been found to
  increase under LPFC inhibition. Behavioral data showed that choice impulsivity increased
  in a group of participants who performed hard versions of executive tasks but not
  in control groups who performed easy versions or enjoyed some leisure time. Functional
  MRI data acquired at the start, middle, and end of the day confirmed that enhancement
  of choice impulsivity was related to a specific decrease in the activity of an LPFC
  region (in the left middle frontal gyrus) that was recruited by both executive and
  choice tasks. Our findings demonstrate a concept of focused neural fatigue that
  might be naturally induced in real-life situations and have important repercussions
  on economic decisions.
