abstract: The impact of sensory acuity, processing speed, and working memory capacity
  on auditory working memory span (L-span) performance at 5 presentation levels was
  examined in 80 young adults (18-30 years of age) and 26 older adults (60-82 years
  of age). Lowering the presentation level of the L-span task had a greater detrimental
  effect on the older adults than on the younger ones. Furthermore, the relationship
  between sensory acuity and L-span performance varied as a function of age and presentation
  level. These results suggest that declining acuity plays an important explanatory
  role in age-related declines in cognitive abilities.
