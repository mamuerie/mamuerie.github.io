abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging
  (fMRI) studies have revealed age-related under-activation, where older adults show
  less regional brain activation compared to younger adults, as well as age-related
  over-activation, where older adults show greater activation compared to younger
  adults. These differences have been found across multiple task domains, including
  verbal working memory (WM). Curiously, both under-activation and over-activation
  of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) have been found for older adults in verbal
  WM tasks. Here, we use event-related fMRI to test the hypothesis that age-related
  differences in activation depend on memory load (the number of items that must be
  maintained). Our predictions about the recruitment of prefrontal executive processes
  are based on the Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis
  (CRUNCH; Reuter-Lorenz and Cappell, 2008). According to this hypothesis, more neural
  resources are engaged by older brains to accomplish computational goals completed
  with fewer resources by younger brains. Therefore, seniors are more likely than
  young adults to show over-activations at lower memory loads, and under-activations
  at higher memory loads. Consistent with these predictions, in right DLPFC, we observed
  age-related over-activation with lower memory loads despite equivalent performance
  accuracy across age groups. In contrast, with the highest memory load, older adults
  were significantly less accurate and showed less DLPFC activation compared to their
  younger counterparts. These results are considered in relation to previous reports
  of activation-performance relations using similar tasks, and are found to support
  the viability of CRUNCH as an account of age-related compensation and its potential
  costs.
