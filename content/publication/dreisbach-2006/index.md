abstract: In 2 experiments, the authors compare stimulus-based versus task-rule-based
  task performance. Participants practiced 8 stimulus-response mappings either with
  or without knowledge about 2 underlying task sets. After practice, 2 transfer blocks
  with 8 new stimuli were presented. Results show that rule knowledge leads to significant
  switch and transfer costs, whereas without rule knowledge neither switch nor transfer
  costs occur. However, significant Task Type x Response Type interactions occurred
  in both conditions. In a second experiment including only the no rule condition,
  half of the stimulus-response mappings in the transfer blocks were incongruent to
  the underlying task rule. Slower response times for these incongruent stimuli as
  compared with congruent stimuli and the absence of switch costs suggest that participants
  acquired (presumably implicit) knowledge about 4 different stimulus-response categories.
