abstract: 'Studies in humans and non-human primates have provided evidence for storage
  of working memory contents in multiple regions ranging from sensory to parietal
  and prefrontal cortex. We discuss potential explanations for these distributed representations:
  (i) features in sensory regions versus prefrontal cortex differ in the level of
  abstractness and generalizability; and (ii) features in prefrontal cortex reflect
  representations that are transformed for guidance of upcoming behavioral actions.
  We propose that the propensity to produce persistent activity is a general feature
  of cortical networks. Future studies may have to shift focus from asking where working
  memory can be observed in the brain to how a range of specialized brain areas together
  transform sensory information into a delayed behavioral response.'
