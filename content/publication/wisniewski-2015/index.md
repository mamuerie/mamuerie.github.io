abstract: 'Rewards obtained from specific behaviors can and do change across time.
  To adapt to such conditions, humans need to represent and update associations between
  behaviors and their outcomes. Much previous work focused on how rewards affect the
  processing of specific tasks. However, abstract associations between multiple potential
  behaviors and multiple rewards are an important basis for adaptation as well. In
  this experiment, we directly investigated which brain areas represent associations
  between multiple tasks and rewards, using time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis
  of functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Importantly, we were able to dissociate
  neural signals reflecting task-reward associations from those related to task preparation
  and reward expectation processes, variables that were often correlated in previous
  research. We hypothesized that brain regions involved in processing tasks and/or
  rewards will be involved in processing associations between them. Candidate areas
  included the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, which is involved in associating
  simple actions and rewards, and the parietal cortex, which has been shown to represent
  task rules and action values. Our results indicate that local spatial activation
  patterns in the inferior parietal cortex indeed represent task-reward associations.
  Interestingly, the parietal cortex flexibly changes its content of representation
  within trials. It first represents task-reward associations, later switching to
  process tasks and rewards directly. These findings highlight the importance of the
  inferior parietal cortex in associating behaviors with their outcomes and further
  show that it can flexibly reconfigure its function within single trials. Significance
  statement: Rewards obtained from specific behaviors rarely remain constant over
  time. To adapt to changing conditions, humans need to continuously update and represent
  the current association between behavior and its outcomes. However, little is known
  about the neural representation of behavior-outcome associations. Here, we used
  multivariate pattern analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data to investigate
  the neural correlates of such associations. Our results demonstrate that the parietal
  cortex plays a central role in representing associations between multiple behaviors
  and their outcomes. They further highlight the flexibility of the parietal cortex,
  because we find it to adapt its function to changing task demands within trials
  on relatively short timescales.'
