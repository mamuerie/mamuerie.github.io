abstract: Complex auditory scenes pose a challenge to attentive listening, rendering
  listeners slower and more uncertain in their perceptual decisions. How can we explain
  such behaviors from the dynamics of cortical networks that pertain to the control
  of listening behavior? We here follow up on the hypothesis that human adaptive perception
  in challenging listening situations is supported by modular reconfiguration of auditory–control
  networks in a sample of               N               ,=,40 participants (13 males)
  who underwent resting-state and task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
  Individual titration of a spatial selective auditory attention task maintained an
  average accuracy of ∼70% but yielded considerable interindividual differences in
  listeners’ response speed and reported confidence in their own perceptual decisions.
  Whole-brain network modularity increased from rest to task by reconfiguring auditory,
  cinguloopercular, and dorsal attention networks. Specifically, interconnectivity
  between the auditory network and cinguloopercular network decreased during the task
  relative to the resting state. Additionally, interconnectivity between the dorsal
  attention network and cinguloopercular network increased. These interconnectivity
  dynamics were predictive of individual differences in response confidence, the degree
  of which was more pronounced after incorrect judgments. Our findings uncover the
  behavioral relevance of functional cross talk between auditory and attentional-control
  networks during metacognitive assessment of one's own perception in challenging
  listening situations and suggest two functionally dissociable cortical networked
  systems that shape the considerable metacognitive differences between individuals
  in adaptive listening behavior.
