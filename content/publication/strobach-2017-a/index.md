abstract: 'In dual-task situations, interference between two simultaneous tasks impairs
  performance. With practice, however, this impairment can be reduced. To identify
  mechanisms leading to a practice-related improvement in sensorimotor dual tasks,
  the present review applied the following general hypothesis: Sources that impair
  dual-task performance at the beginning of practice are associated with mechanisms
  for the reduction of dual-task impairment at the end of practice. The following
  types of processes provide sources for the occurrence of this impairment: (a) capacity-limited
  processes within the component tasks, such as response-selection or motor response
  stages, and (b) cognitive control processes independent of these tasks and thus
  operating outside of component-task performance. Dual-task practice studies show
  that, under very specific conditions, capacity-limited processes within the component
  tasks are automatized with practice, reducing the interference between two simultaneous
  tasks. Further, there is evidence that response-selection stages are shortened with
  practice. Thus, capacity limitations at these stages are sources for dual-task costs
  at the beginning of practice and are overcome with practice. However, there is no
  evidence demonstrating the existence of practice-related mechanisms associated with
  capacity-limited motor-response stages. Further, during practice, there is an acquisition
  of executive control skills for an improved allocation of limited attention resources
  to two tasks as well as some evidence supporting the assumption of improved task
  coordination. These latter mechanisms are associated with sources of dual-task interference
  operating outside of component task performance at the beginning of practice and
  also contribute to the reduction of dual-task interference at its end.'
