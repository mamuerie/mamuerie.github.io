abstract: Long lasting involvement in a cognitive task leads to mental fatigue. Substantial
  efforts have been undertaken to understand this phenomenon. However, it has been
  demonstrated that some changes with time on task are not only related to mental
  fatigue. The present study intends to clarify these effects of time on task unrelated
  to mental fatigue on response selection processes at the behavioural and electrophysiological
  level (using event-related potentials, ERPs). Participants had to perform a Simon
  task for more than 3,hours and rated their experienced mental fatigue and motivation
  to continue with the task at several time points during the experiment. The results
  show that at the beginning of the experiment some unspecific modulations of training
  and adaptation are evident. With time on task participants' ability to resolve response
  conflict appears to become impaired. The results reveal that time on task effects
  cannot be completely explained by mental fatigue. Instead, it seems that an interplay
  of adaptation at the beginning and motivational effects in the course of a task
  modulate performance and neurophysiological parameters. In future studies it will
  be important to account for the relative contribution of adaptation and motivation
  parameters when time on task effects are investigated.
