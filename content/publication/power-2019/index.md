abstract: 'Head motion causes artifacts in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
  scans, a problem especially relevant for task-free resting state paradigms and for
  developmental, aging, and clinical populations. In a cohort spanning 7-28 years
  old (mean age 15) we produced customized head-anatomy-specific Styrofoam molds for
  each subject that inserted into an MRI head coil. We scanned these subjects under
  two conditions: using our standard procedure of packing the head coil with foam
  padding about the head to reduce head motion, and using the customized molds to
  reduce head motion. In 12 of 13 subjects, the molds reduced head motion throughout
  the scan and reduced the fraction of a scan with substantial motion (i.e., volumes
  with motion notably above baseline levels of motion). Motion was reduced in all
  6 head position estimates, especially in rotational, left-right, and superior-inferior
  directions. Motion was reduced throughout the full age range studied, including
  children, adolescents, and young adults. In terms of the fMRI data itself, quality
  indices improved with the head mold on, scrubbing analyses detected less distance-dependent
  artifact in scans with the head mold on, and distant-dependent artifact was less
  evident in both the entire scan and also during only low-motion volumes. Subjects
  found the molds comfortable. Head molds are thus effective tools for reducing head
  motion, and motion artifacts, during fMRI scans.'
