abstract: Long-term storage of episodic memories is hypothesized to result from the
  off-line transfer of information from the hippocampus to neocortex, allowing a hippocampal-independent
  cortical representation to emerge. However, off-line hippocampal-cortical interactions
  have not been demonstrated to be linked with long-term memory. Here, using functional
  magnetic resonance imaging, we examined if hippocampal-cortical BOLD correlations
  during rest following an associative encoding task are related to later associative
  memory performance. Our data show enhanced functional connectivity between the hippocampus
  and a portion of the lateral occipital complex (LO) during rest following a task
  with high subsequent memory compared to pretask baseline resting connectivity. This
  effect is not seen during rest following a task with poor subsequent memory. Furthermore,
  the magnitude of hippocampal-LO correlations during posttask rest predicts individual
  differences in later associative memory. These results demonstrate the importance
  of postexperience resting brain correlations for memory for recent experiences.
