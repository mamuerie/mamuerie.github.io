abstract: 'Homotopic functional connectivity reflects the degree of synchrony in spontaneous
  activity between homologous voxels in the two hemispheres. Previous studies have
  associated increased brain homotopy and decreased white matter integrity with performance
  decrements on different cognitive tasks across the life-span. Here, we correlated
  functional homotopy, both at the whole-brain level and specifically in fronto-parietal
  network nodes, with task-switching performance in young adults. Cue-to-target intervals
  (CTI: 300 vs. 1200 ms) were manipulated on a trial-by-trial basis to modulate cognitive
  demands and strategic control. We found that mixing costs, a measure of task-set
  maintenance and monitoring, were significantly correlated to homotopy in different
  nodes of the fronto-parietal network depending on CTI. In particular, mixing costs
  for short CTI trials were smaller with lower homotopy in the superior frontal gyrus,
  whereas mixing costs for long CTI trials were smaller with lower homotopy in the
  supramarginal gyrus. These results were specific to the fronto-parietal network,
  as similar voxel-wise analyses within a control language network did not yield significant
  correlations with behavior. These findings extend previous literature on the relationship
  between homotopy and cognitive performance to task-switching, and show a dissociable
  role of homotopy in different fronto-parietal nodes depending on task demands.'
