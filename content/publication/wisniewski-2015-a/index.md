abstract: When choosing actions, humans have to balance carefully between different
  task demands. On the one hand, they should perform tasks repeatedly to avoid frequent
  and effortful switching between different tasks. On the other hand, subjects have
  to retain their flexibility to adapt to changes in external task demands such as
  switching away from an increasingly difficult task. Here, we developed a difficulty-based
  choice task to investigate how subjects voluntarily select task-sets in predictably
  changing environments. Subjects were free to choose 1 of the 3 task-sets on a trial-by-trial
  basis, while the task difficulty changed dynamically over time. Subjects self-sequenced
  their behavior in this environment while we measured brain responses with functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using multivariate decoding, we found that task
  choices were encoded in the medial prefrontal cortex (dorso-medial prefrontal cortex,
  dmPFC, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, dACC). The same regions were found
  to encode task difficulty, a major factor influencing choices. Importantly, the
  present paradigm allowed us to disentangle the neural code for task choices and
  task difficulty, ensuring that activation patterns in dmPFC/dACC independently encode
  these 2 factors. This finding provides new evidence for the importance of the dmPFC/dACC
  for task-selection and motivational functions in highly dynamic environments.
