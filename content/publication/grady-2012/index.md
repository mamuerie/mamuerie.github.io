abstract: The availability of neuroimaging technology has spurred a marked increase
  in the human cognitive neuroscience literature, including the study of cognitive
  ageing. Although there is a growing consensus that the ageing brain retains considerable
  plasticity of function, currently measured primarily by means of functional MRI,
  it is less clear how age differences in brain activity relate to cognitive performance.
  The field is also hampered by the complexity of the ageing process itself and the
  large number of factors that are influenced by age. In this Review, current trends
  and unresolved issues in the cognitive neuroscience of ageing are discussed.
