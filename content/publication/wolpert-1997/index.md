abstract: 'This review will focus on four areas of motor control which have recently
  been enriched both by neural network and control system models: motor planning,
  motor prediction, state estimation and motor learning. We will review the computational
  foundations of each of these concepts and present specific models which have been
  tested by psychophysical experiments. We will cover the topics of optimal control
  for motor planning, forward models for motor prediction, observer models of state
  estimation arid modular decomposition in motor learning. The aim of this review
  is to demonstrate how computational approaches, as well as proposing specific models,
  provide a theoretical framework to formalize the issues in motor control.'
