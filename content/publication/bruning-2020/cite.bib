 abstract = {Previous research has shown that individuals differ with respect to their preferred strategies in self-organized multitasking: They either prefer to work on one task for long sequences before switching to another (blocking), prefer to switch repeatedly after short sequences (switching), or prefer to respond almost simultaneously after processing the stimuli of two concurrently visible tasks (response grouping). In two experiments, we tested to what extent the choice of strategy and related differences in multitasking efficiency were affected by the between-resource competition (Wickens, 2002) of two tasks to be performed concurrently in a self-organized manner. All participants performed a set of dual tasks that differed with respect to the kind of stimuli (verbal vs. spatial) and/or responses (manual vs. vocal). The choice of strategy was hardly affected as most individuals persisted in their response strategy independent of the degree of resource competition. However, the efficiency of individuals preferring a switching or response-grouping strategy increased especially when the reduction in resource competition was response related (manual vs. vocal), leading even to considerable dual-tasking benefits under these circumstances. In contrast, individuals who preferred to block their responses did not achieve any considerable benefits (or costs) with either of the different dual tasks.
