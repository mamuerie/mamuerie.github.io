abstract: 'Previous research has shown that individuals differ with respect to their
  preferred strategies in self-organized multitasking: They either prefer to work
  on one task for long sequences before switching to another (blocking), prefer to
  switch repeatedly after short sequences (switching), or prefer to respond almost
  simultaneously after processing the stimuli of two concurrently visible tasks (response
  grouping). In two experiments, we tested to what extent the choice of strategy and
  related differences in multitasking efficiency were affected by the between-resource
  competition (Wickens, 2002) of two tasks to be performed concurrently in a self-organized
  manner. All participants performed a set of dual tasks that differed with respect
  to the kind of stimuli (verbal vs. spatial) and/or responses (manual vs. vocal).
  The choice of strategy was hardly affected as most individuals persisted in their
  response strategy independent of the degree of resource competition. However, the
  efficiency of individuals preferring a switching or response-grouping strategy increased
  especially when the reduction in resource competition was response related (manual
  vs. vocal), leading even to considerable dual-tasking benefits under these circumstances.
  In contrast, individuals who preferred to block their responses did not achieve
  any considerable benefits (or costs) with either of the different dual tasks. (PsycInfo
