abstract: Previous experiments investigating ERP correlates of anticipatory attention
  shifts triggered by central symbolic cues have identified a contralateral \"early
  directing attention negativity,\" which was assumed to be generated by processes
  involved in the control of spatial orienting. Here we demonstrate that this component
  is not directly linked to the control of attentional shifts, but instead reflects
  the selection of task-relevant aspects of cue stimuli. In contrast, later ERP components
  triggered during covert attentional shifts are insensitive to physical cue attributes,
  and thus appear to be genuine electrophysiological correlates of covert attentional
  control mechanisms.
