abstract: Most biological and artificial neural systems are capable of completing
  multiple tasks. However, the neural mechanism by which multiple tasks are accomplished
  within the same system is largely unclear. We start by discussing how different
  tasks can be related, and methods to generate large sets of inter-related tasks
  to study how neural networks and animals perform multiple tasks. We then argue that
  there are mechanisms that emphasize either specialization or flexibility. We will
  review two such neural mechanisms underlying multiple tasks at the neuronal level
  (modularity and mixed selectivity), and discuss how different mechanisms can emerge
  depending on training methods in neural networks.
