 abstract = {Adaptive control refers to flexible adjustments in control settings in response to conflicting situations. There has been a long-standing debate as to whether this adaptation relies on a domain-general or domain-specific process. Recent models predict a U-shaped relation where only highly similar or highly dissimilar tasks show adaptation across tasks, because only those tasks can be represented or activated in parallel. While there has been an abundance of evidence for adaptation within and across highly similar tasks, only some recent studies have reported adaptation across highly dissimilar tasks, with some failures to replicate. In order to further investigate this, we interleaved two very different conflict tasks, a manual multi-source interference task and a vocal picture-word interference task. We ran this experiment in Dutch (Experiment 1) and Mandarin (Experiment 2). Across the two experiments, results show no cross-task conflict adaptation. These results do not fit with suggestion of domain-general adaptive processes nor with the hypothesis of a U-shaped model. Instead, our results are most compatible with a task-specific view on the mechanisms behind adaptive control.},
