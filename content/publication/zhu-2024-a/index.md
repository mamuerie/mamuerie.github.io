abstract: Adaptive control refers to flexible adjustments in control settings in response
  to conflicting situations. There has been a long-standing debate as to whether this
  adaptation relies on a domain-general or domain-specific process. Recent models
  predict a U-shaped relation where only highly similar or highly dissimilar tasks
  show adaptation across tasks, because only those tasks can be represented or activated
  in parallel. While there has been an abundance of evidence for adaptation within
  and across highly similar tasks, only some recent studies have reported adaptation
  across highly dissimilar tasks, with some failures to replicate. In order to further
  investigate this, we interleaved two very different conflict tasks, a manual multi-source
  interference task and a vocal picture-word interference task. We ran this experiment
  in Dutch (Experiment 1) and Mandarin (Experiment 2). Across the two experiments,
  results show no cross-task conflict adaptation. These results do not fit with suggestion
  of domain-general adaptive processes nor with the hypothesis of a U-shaped model.
  Instead, our results are most compatible with a task-specific view on the mechanisms
  behind adaptive control.
