abstract: Mental fatigue is one of the main reasons for the decline of response inhibition.
  This study aimed to explore the impairing influence of mental fatigue on a driver's
  response inhibition. The effects of mental fatigue on response inhibition were assessed
  by comparing brain activity and behavioral indices when performing a Go/NoGo task
  before and after a 90-min fatigue manipulation task. Participants in the driving
  group performed a simulated driving task, while individuals in the control group
  spent the same time watching movies. We found that participants in the driving group
  reported higher levels of mental fatigue and had a higher percentage of eye closure
  and larger lateral deviations from their lane positions, which indicated there was
  effective manipulation of mental fatigue through a prolonged simulated driving task.
  After manipulation of mental fatigue, we observed increased reaction time and miss
  rates, delayed NoGo-N2 latency and Go-P3 latency, and decreased NoGo-P3 amplitude,
  which indicated that mental fatigue may slow down the speed of the inhibition process,
  delay the evaluation of visual stimuli and reduce the availability of attentional
  resources. These findings revealed the underlying neurological mechanisms of how
  mental fatigue impaired response inhibition.
