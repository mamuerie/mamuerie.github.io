abstract: Input-output (I-O) modality compatibility refers to the similarity of stimulus
  modality and modality of response-related sensory consequences. A previous study
  found higher switch costs in task switching in I-O modality incompatible tasks (auditory-manual
  and visual-vocal) than in I-O modality compatible tasks (auditory-vocal and visual-manual).
  However, these tasks had spatially compatible S-R mappings, which implied dimensional
  overlap (DO). DO may have led to automatic activation of the corresponding compatible
  responses in the incorrect response modality, thus increasing interference effects.
  The present study was aimed to examine the influence of DO on I-O modality compatibility
  effects. In two experiments, we found that I-O modality compatibility affects task
  switching even in tasks without DO, which even tended to result in further increased
  modality influences. This finding suggests that I-O modality mappings affect response
  selection by affecting between-task cross-talk not on the level of specific response
  codes but on the level of modality-specific processing pathways.
