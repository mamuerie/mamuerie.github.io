abstract: Information enters the cortex via modality-specific sensory regions, whereas
  actions are produced by modality-specific motor regions. Intervening central stages
  of information processing map sensation to behavior. Humans perform this central
  processing in a flexible, abstract manner such that sensory information in any modality
  can lead to response via any motor system. Cognitive theories account for such flexible
  behavior by positing amodal central information processing (e.g., \"central executive,\"
  Baddeley and Hitch, 1974; \"supervisory attentional system,\" Norman and Shallice,
  1986; \"response selection bottleneck,\" Pashler, 1994). However, the extent to
  which brain regions embodying central mechanisms of information processing are amodal
  remains unclear. Here we apply multivariate pattern analysis to functional magnetic
  resonance imaging (fMRI) data to compare response selection, a cognitive process
  widely believed to recruit an amodal central resource across sensory and motor modalities.
  We show that most frontal and parietal cortical areas known to activate across a
  wide variety of tasks code modality, casting doubt on the notion that these regions
  embody a central processor devoid of modality representation. Importantly, regions
  of anterior insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex consistently failed to code
  modality across four experiments. However, these areas code at least one other task
  dimension, process (instantiated as response selection vs response execution), ensuring
  that failure to find coding of modality is not driven by insensitivity of multivariate
  pattern analysis in these regions. We conclude that abstract encoding of information
  modality is primarily a property of subregions of the prefrontal cortex.
