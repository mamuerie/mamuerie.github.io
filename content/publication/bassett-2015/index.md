abstract: Distributed networks of brain areas interact with one another in a time-varying
  fashion to enable complex cognitive and sensorimotor functions. Here we used new
  network-analysis algorithms to test the recruitment and integration of large-scale
  functional neural circuitry during learning. Using functional magnetic resonance
  imaging data acquired from healthy human participants, we investigated changes in
  the architecture of functional connectivity patterns that promote learning from
  initial training through mastery of a simple motor skill. Our results show that
  learning induces an autonomy of sensorimotor systems and that the release of cognitive
  control hubs in frontal and cingulate cortices predicts individual differences in
  the rate of learning on other days of practice. Our general statistical approach
  is applicable across other cognitive domains and provides a key to understanding
  time-resolved interactions between distributed neural circuits that enable task
  performance.
