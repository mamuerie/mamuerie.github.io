abstract: Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of functional
  magnetic resonance imaging studies seeking to answer questions about how the brain
  represents information. Representational questions are of particular importance
  in connecting neuroscientific and cognitive levels of analysis because it is at
  the representational level that many formal models of cognition make distinct predictions.
  This review discusses techniques for univariate, adaptation, and multivoxel analysis,
  and how they have been used to answer questions about content specificity in different
  regions of the brain, how this content is organized, and how representations are
  shaped by and contribute to cognitive processes. Each of the analysis techniques
  makes different assumptions about the underlying neural code and thus differ in
  how they can be applied to specific questions. We also discuss the many pitfalls
  of representational analysis, from the flexibility in data analysis pipelines to
  emergent nonrepresentational relationships that can arise between stimuli in a task.
