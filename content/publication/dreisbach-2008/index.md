abstract: Goal-directed behavior requires the cognitive system to distinguish between
  relevant and irrelevant information. The authors show that task sets help to shield
  the system from irrelevant information. Participants had to respond to eight different
  colored word stimuli under different instruction conditions. They either had to
  learn the stimulus-response mappings (SR condition), to use one task set (1 TS condition)
  or to use two different task sets (2 TS condition). In the 2 TS and the SR conditions,
  participants showed response repetition effects (interaction of color repetition
  x response repetition), indicating that participants processed the color of the
  words. Importantly, the 1 TS condition did not show such an interaction. Overall,
  the results provide evidence for the shielding function of task sets. This benefit
  turns into costs in classical task switching paradigms. From this perspective, switch
  costs can be interpreted as the consequence of successful shielding on the previous
  task.
