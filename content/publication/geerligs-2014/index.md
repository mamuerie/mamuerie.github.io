abstract: The importance of studying connectivity in the aging brain is increasingly
  recognized. Recent studies have shown that connectivity within the default mode
  network is reduced with age and have demonstrated a clear relation of these changes
  with cognitive functioning. However, research on age-related changes in other functional
  networks is sparse and mainly focused on prespecified functional networks. Using
  functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated age-related changes in functional
  connectivity during a visual oddball task in a range of functional networks. It
  was found that compared with young participants, elderly showed a decrease in connectivity
  between areas belonging to the same functional network. This was found in the default
  mode network and the somatomotor network. Moreover, in all identified networks,
  elderly showed increased connectivity between areas within these networks and areas
  belonging to different functional networks. Decreased connectivity within functional
  networks was related to poorer cognitive functioning in elderly. The results were
  interpreted as a decrease in the specificity of functional networks in older participants.
