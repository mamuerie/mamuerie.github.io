abstract: 'Previous studies on multitasking suggest that performance decline during
  concurrent task processing arises from interfering brain modules. Here, we used
  graph-theoretical network analysis to define functional brain modules and relate
  the modular organization of complex brain networks to behavioral dual-task costs.
  Based on resting-state and task fMRI we explored two organizational aspects potentially
  associated with behavioral interference when human subjects performed a visuospatial
  and speech task simultaneously: the topological overlap between persistent single-task
  modules, and the flexibility of single-task modules in adaptation to the dual-task
  condition. Participants showed a significant decline in visuospatial accuracy in
  the dual-task compared with single visuospatial task. Global analysis of topological
  similarity between modules revealed that the overlap between single-task modules
  significantly correlated with the decline in visuospatial accuracy. Subjects with
  larger overlap between single-task modules showed higher behavioral interference.
  Furthermore, lower flexible reconfiguration of single-task modules in adaptation
  to the dual-task condition significantly correlated with larger decline in visuospatial
  accuracy. Subjects with lower modular flexibility showed higher behavioral interference.
  At the regional level, higher overlap between single-task modules and less modular
  flexibility in the somatomotor cortex positively correlated with the decline in
  visuospatial accuracy. Additionally, higher modular flexibility in cingulate and
  frontal control areas and lower flexibility in right-lateralized nodes comprising
  the middle occipital and superior temporal gyri supported dual-tasking. Our results
  suggest that persistency and flexibility of brain modules are important determinants
  of dual-task costs. We conclude that efficient dual-tasking benefits from a specific
  balance between flexibility and rigidity of functional brain modules.'
