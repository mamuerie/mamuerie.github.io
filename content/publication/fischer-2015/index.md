abstract: In the context of performance optimizations in multitasking, a central debate
  has unfolded in multitasking research around whether cognitive processes related
  to different tasks proceed only sequentially (one at a time), or can operate in
  parallel (simultaneously). This review features a discussion of theoretical considerations
  and empirical evidence regarding parallel versus serial task processing in multitasking.
  In addition, we highlight how methodological differences and theoretical conceptions
  determine the extent to which parallel processing in multitasking can be detected,
  to guide their employment in future research. Parallel and serial processing of
  multiple tasks are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, questions focusing exclusively
  on either task-processing mode are too simplified. We review empirical evidence
  and demonstrate that shifting between more parallel and more serial task processing
  critically depends on the conditions under which multiple tasks are performed. We
  conclude that efficient multitasking is reflected by the ability of individuals
  to adjust multitasking performance to environmental demands by flexibly shifting
  between different processing strategies of multiple task-component scheduling.
