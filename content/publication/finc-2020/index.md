abstract: The functional network of the brain continually adapts to changing environmental
  demands. The consequence of behavioral automation for task-related functional network
  architecture remains far from understood. We investigated the neural reflections
  of behavioral automation as participants mastered a dual n-back task. In four fMRI
  scans equally spanning a 6-week training period,~we assessed brain network modularity,~a
  substrate for adaptation in biological systems. We found that whole-brain modularity
  steadily increased during training for both conditions of the dual n-back task.
  In a dynamic analysis,we found that the autonomy of the default mode system and
  integration among task-positive systems were modulated by training. The automation
  of the n-back task through training resulted in non-linear changes in integration
  between the fronto-parietal and default mode systems,~and integration with the subcortical
  system. Our findings suggest that the automation of a cognitively demanding task
  may result in more segregated network organization.
