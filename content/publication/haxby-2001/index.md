abstract: The functional architecture of the object vision pathway in the human brain
  was investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure patterns
  of response in ventral temporal cortex while subjects viewed faces, cats, five categories
  of man-made objects, and nonsense pictures. A distinct pattern of response was found
  for each stimulus category. The distinctiveness of the response to a given category
  was not due simply to the regions that responded maximally to that category, because
  the category being viewed also could be identified on the basis of the pattern of
  response when those regions were excluded from the analysis. Patterns of response
  that discriminated among all categories were found even within cortical regions
  that responded maximally to only one category. These results indicate that the representations
  of faces and objects in ventral temporal cortex are widely distributed and overlapping.
