abstract: 'This investigation assessed the impact of three cognitively demanding tasks
  on cognitive performance, subjective, and physiological indicators of mental fatigue.
  Following familiarization, participants completed four testing sessions, separated
  by 48,h. During each session, participants watched a 45-min emotionally neutral
  documentary (control) or completed one of the following computer tasks: Psychomotor
  Vigilance Task (PVT); AX-Continuous Performance Test (AX-CPT); or Stroop Task. Mental
  fatigue was assessed before and at regular periods for 60,min following the 45-min
  treatments. Cognitive performance was assessed using 3-min PVT, and task performance.
  Subjective assessments were conducted using the Brunel Mood Scale, and visual analog
  scales (VAS). Physiological indicators of mental fatigue included electroencephalography
  (EEG), and heart rate variability (HRV). Subjective ratings of mental fatigue increased
  from pre to 0-min post in all-treatments, but not the documentary (p,$<$,0.05).
  Subjective fatigue (VAS) remained higher (p,$<$,0.05) than pretreatment values for
  20-, 50-, and 60-min following the PVT, Stroop, and AX-CPT respectively. The cognitively
  demanding tasks had unclear effects on 3-min PVT, EEG, and HRV assessments. Tasks
  requiring response inhibition appear to induce fatigue for longer durations than
  a simple vigilance task. Simple VAS appear to be the most practical method for assessing
  mental fatigue.'
