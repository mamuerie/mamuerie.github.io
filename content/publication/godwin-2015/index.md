abstract: Neurobiological theories of awareness propose divergent accounts of the
  spatial extent of brain changes that support conscious perception. Whereas focal
  theories posit mostly local regional changes, global theories propose that awareness
  emerges from the propagation of neural signals across a broad extent of sensory
  and association cortex. Here we tested the scalar extent of brain changes associated
  with awareness using graph theoretical analysis applied to functional connectivity
  data acquired at ultra-high field while subjects performed a simple masked target
  detection task. We found that awareness of a visual target is associated with a
  degradation of the modularity of the brain’s functional networks brought about by
  an increase in intermodular functional connectivity. These results provide compelling
  evidence that awareness is associated with truly global changes in the brain’s functional
  connectivity.
