abstract: Recent fMRI studies suggest that the inferior frontal sulcus (IFS) is involved
  in the coordination of interfering processes in dual-task situations. The present
  study aims to further specify this assumption by investigating whether the compatibility
  between stimulus and response modalities modulates dual-task-related activity along
  the IFS. It has been shown behaviorally that the degree of interference, as measured
  by dual-task costs, increases in modality-incompatible conditions (e.g. visual-vocal
  tasks combined with auditory-manual tasks) as compared to modality-compatible conditions
  (e.g. visual-manual tasks combined with auditory-vocal tasks). Using fMRI, we measured
  IFS activity when participants performed modality-compatible and modality-incompatible
  single and dual tasks. Behaviorally, we replicated the finding of higher dual-task
  costs for modality-incompatible tasks compared to modality-compatible tasks. The
  fMRI data revealed higher activity along the IFS in modality-incompatible dual tasks
  compared with modality-compatible dual tasks when inter-individual variability in
  functional brain organization is taken into account. We argue that in addition to
  temporal order coordination (Szameitat et al., 2002), the IFS is involved in the
  coordination of cognitive processes associated with the concurrent mapping of sensory
  information onto corresponding motor responses in dual-task situations.
