abstract: Given concerns about the reproducibility of scientific findings, neuroimaging
  must define best practices for data analysis, results reporting, and algorithm and
  data sharing to promote transparency, reliability and collaboration. We describe
  insights from developing a set of recommendations on behalf of the Organization
  for Human Brain Mapping and identify barriers that impede these practices, including
  how the discipline must change to fully exploit the potential of the world's neuroimaging
  data.
