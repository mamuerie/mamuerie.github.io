abstract: "Multitasking is a common requirement in many occupations. Considerable
  research has demonstrated that performance declines as a result of multitasking,
  and that it engages multiple brain regions. Despite growing evidence suggesting
  that brain regions operate as networks, minimal research has investigated the cognitive
  brain networks implicated in multitasking. The Multi-Attribute Task Battery II (MATB)
  is a common method for assessing multitasking ability that simulates a pilot's operational
  environment inside an aircraft cockpit. The aim of the present study was to examine
  multitasking performance on the MATB, and the associated neural patterns underlying
  performance with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-four participants
  completed the MATB in the fMRI scanner. Participants completed four runs of the
  MATB in a 2 (Task: multitasking vs. single tasking)~Ã—~2 (Difficulty: hard vs. easy)
  design. MATB performance was measured as a function of accuracy. We analyzed the
  fMRI brain scans using both static and dynamic functional connectivity to determine
  whether there were differences in the connectivity patterns associated with each
  of the four conditions. A significant interaction between Task and Difficulty was
  observed such that multitasking performance accuracy, which was derived from the
  average across tasks, was lower than single tasking in the hard, but not easy, condition.
  The fMRI data revealed that static and dynamic functional connectivity between the
  default mode and dorsal attention networks was stronger during multitasking relative
  to single tasking. The static functional connectivity between the default mode and
  left frontoparietal networks, along with the dynamic functional connectivity between
  the dorsal attention and left frontoparietal networks, were both more anti-correlated
  during multitasking relative to single tasking. Taken together, the static and dynamic
  functional connectivity analyses provide complementary information to reveal the
  interactions among cognitive networks that support multitasking performance. Targeting
  these networks may offer a path to enhance multitasking ability through the application
  of neurostimulation and neuroenhancement techniques."
