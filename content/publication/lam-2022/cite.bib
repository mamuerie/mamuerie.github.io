 abstract = {Multitasking is a common requirement in many occupations. Considerable research has demonstrated that performance declines as a result of multitasking, and that it engages multiple brain regions. Despite growing evidence suggesting that brain regions operate as networks, minimal research has investigated the cognitive brain networks implicated in multitasking. The Multi-Attribute Task Battery II (MATB) is a common method for assessing multitasking ability that simulates a pilot's operational environment inside an aircraft cockpit. The aim of the present study was to examine multitasking performance on the MATB, and the associated neural patterns underlying performance with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-four participants completed the MATB in the fMRI scanner. Participants completed four runs of the MATB in a 2 (Task: multitasking vs. single tasking)~×~2 (Difficulty: hard vs. easy) design. MATB performance was measured as a function of accuracy. We analyzed the fMRI brain scans using both static and dynamic functional connectivity to determine whether there were differences in the connectivity patterns associated with each of the four conditions. A significant interaction between Task and Difficulty was observed such that multitasking performance accuracy, which was derived from the average across tasks, was lower than single tasking in the hard, but not easy, condition. The fMRI data revealed that static and dynamic functional connectivity between the default mode and dorsal attention networks was stronger during multitasking relative to single tasking. The static functional connectivity between the default mode and left frontoparietal networks, along with the dynamic functional connectivity between the dorsal attention and left frontoparietal networks, were both more anti-correlated during multitasking relative to single tasking. Taken together, the static and dynamic functional connectivity analyses provide complementary information to reveal the interactions among cognitive networks that support multitasking performance. Targeting these networks may offer a path to enhance multitasking ability through the application of neurostimulation and neuroenhancement techniques.},
