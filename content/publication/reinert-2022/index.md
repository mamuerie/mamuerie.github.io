abstract: Recently, reliable interindividual differences were found for the way how
  individuals process multiple tasks (at a cognitive level) and how they organize
  their responses (at a response level). Previous studies have shown mixed results
  with respect to the flexibility of these preferences. On the one hand, individuals
  tend to adjust their preferred task processing mode to varying degrees of risk of
  crosstalk between tasks. On the other, response strategies were observed to be highly
  stable under varying between-resource competition. In the present study, we investigated
  whether the stability of response strategies also persists with increased risk of
  crosstalk or whether individuals adjust their choice of response strategy, similar
  to what has been found at the level of task processing modes. Besides, related differences
  in multitasking efficiency were assessed. For this purpose, 53 participants performed
  the Free Concurrent Dual-Tasking (FCDT) paradigm, which allows them to control their
  task scheduling and response organization. The participants completed the FCDT paradigm
  under two conditions including task pairs characterized by either low or high levels
  of risk of crosstalk. The free choice of task scheduling resulted in the previously
  found distinct response patterns, best described as blocking, switching or response
  grouping. Remarkably, we did not find any notable adjustments of strategies of response
  organization to the extent of crosstalk. However, we observed suspected performance
  decrements of a switching strategy in the condition of high risk of crosstalk. The
  results suggest that individual strategies of response organization are stable habits.
  Further, they illustrate disadvantages of switching vs. blocking strategies of response
  organization in case of high task similarity.
