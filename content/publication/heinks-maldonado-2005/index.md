abstract: The cortex suppresses sensory information when it is the result of a self-produced
  motor act, including the motor act of speaking. The specificity of the auditory
  cortical suppression to self-produced speech, a prediction derived from the posited
  operation of a precise forward model system, has not been established. We examined
  the auditory N100 component of the event-related brain potential elicited during
  speech production. While subjects uttered a vowel, they heard real-time feedback
  of their unaltered voice, their pitch-shifted voice, or an alien voice substituted
  for their own. The subjects' own unaltered voice feedback elicited a dampened auditory
  N100 response relative to the N100 elicited by altered or alien auditory feedback.
  This is consistent with the operation of a precise forward model modulating the
  auditory cortical response to self-generated speech and allowing immediate distinction
  of self and externally generated auditory stimuli.
