abstract: 'Words activate cortical regions in accordance with their modality of presentation
  (i.e., written vs. spoken), yet there is a long-standing debate about whether patterns
  of activity in any specific brain region capture modality-invariant conceptual information.
  Deficits in patients with semantic dementia highlight the anterior temporal lobe
  (ATL) as an amodal store of semantic knowledge but these studies do not permit precise
  localisation of this function. The current investigation used multiple imaging methods
  in healthy participants to examine functional dissociations within ATL. Multi-voxel
  pattern analysis identified spatially segregated regions: a response to input modality
  in anterior superior temporal gyrus (aSTG) and a response to meaning in more ventral
  anterior temporal lobe (vATL). This functional dissociation was supported by resting-state
  connectivity that found greater coupling for aSTG with primary auditory cortex and
  vATL with the default mode network. A meta-analytic decoding of these connectivity
  patterns implicated aSTG in processes closely tied to auditory processing (such
  as phonology and language) and vATL in meaning-based tasks (such as comprehension
  or social cognition). Thus we provide converging evidence for the segregation of
  meaning and input modality in the ATL.'
