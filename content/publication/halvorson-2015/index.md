abstract: 'Dual-task costs can be greatly reduced or even eliminated when both tasks
  use highly-compatible S-R associations. According to Greenwald (Journal of Experimental
  Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 30, 632-636, 2003), this occurs because
  the appropriate response can be accessed without engaging performance-limiting response
  selection processes, a proposal consistent with the embodied cognition framework
  in that it suggests that stimuli can automatically activate motor codes (e.g., Pezzulo
  et al., New Ideas in Psychology, 31(3), 270-290, 2013). To test this account, we
  reversed the stimulus-response mappings for one or both tasks so that some participants
  had to \"do the opposite\" of what they perceived. In these reversed conditions,
  stimuli resembled the environmental outcome of the alternative (incorrect) response.
  Nonetheless, reversed tasks were performed without costs even when paired with an
  unreversed task. This finding suggests that the separation of the central codes
  across tasks (e.g., Wickens, 1984) is more critical than the specific S-R relationships;
  dual-task costs can be avoided when the tasks engage distinct modality-based systems.'
