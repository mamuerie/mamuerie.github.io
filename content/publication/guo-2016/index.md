abstract: "The impairing effects of mental fatigue on visual sustained attention were
  assessed by event-related potentials (ERPs). Subjects performed a dual visual task,
  which includes a continuous tracking task (primary task) and a random signal detection
  task (secondary task), for 63 minutes nonstop in order to elicit ERPs. In this period,
  the data such as subjective levels of mental fatigue, behavioral performance measures,
  and electroencephalograms were recorded for each subject. Comparing data from the
  first interval (0-25 min) to that of the second, the following phenomena were observed:
  the subjective fatigue ratings increased with time, which indicates that performing
  the tasks leads to increase in mental fatigue levels; reaction times prolonged and
  accuracy rates decreased in the second interval, which indicates that subjects'
  sustained attention decreased.; In the ERP data, the P3 amplitudes elicited by the
  random signals decreased, while the P3 latencies increased in the second interval.
  These results suggest that mental fatigue can modulate the higher-level cognitive
  processes, in terms of less attentional resources allocated to the random stimuli,
  which leads to decreased speed in information evaluating and decision making against
  the stimuli. These findings provide new insights into the question that how mental
  fatigue affects visual sustained attention and, therefore, can help to design countermeasures
  to prevent accidents caused by low visual sustained attention."
