abstract: 'The present study assessed three hypotheses of how practice reduces dual-task
  interference: Practice teaches participants to efficiently integrate performance
  of a task pair; practice promotes automatization of individual tasks, allowing the
  central bottleneck to be bypassed; practice leaves the bottleneck intact but shorter
  in duration. These hypotheses were tested in two transfer-of-training experiments.
  Participants received one of three training types (Task 1 only, or Task 2 only,
  or dual-task), followed by dual-task test sessions. Practice effects in Experiment
  1 (Task 1: auditory-vocal; Task 2: visual-manual) were fully explained by the intact
  bottleneck hypothesis, without task integration or automatization. This hypothesis
  also accounted well for the majority of participants when the task order was reversed
  (Experiment 2). In this case, however, there were multiple indicators that several
  participants had succeeded in eliminating the bottleneck by automatizing one or
  both tasks. Neither experiment provided any evidence that practice promotes efficient
  task integration.'
