abstract: The flow of information from sensory stimuli to motor responses in the human
  brain can be flexibly re-routed depending on task demands. However, it has remained
  unclear which sequence of processes is involved in preparing the brain for an upcoming
  task. Here, we used a combination of fMRI and multivariate pattern classification
  to decompose the information flow in a task-switching experiment. Specifically,
  we present a time-resolved decoding approach that allowed us to track the temporal
  buildup of task-related information. This approach also allowed us to distinguish
  encoding of the task from encoding of target stimuli and motor responses, thus separating
  between different components of information processing. We were able to decode from
  parietal and lateral prefrontal cortex which specific task-set a subject was currently
  holding. Importantly, this revealed that the intraparietal sulcus encoded task-set
  information before prefrontal cortex, and it was the only region to encode the specific
  task-set before the relevant target stimulus was presented. This suggests that task-related
  information in parietal cortex does not rely on input from prefrontal cortex as
  previously suggested. In contrast, our findings suggest that parietal cortex might
  play a role in establishing task-sets in prefrontal cortex.
