abstract: In psychological experiments, participants are typically instructed to respond
  as fast as possible without sacrificing accuracy. How they interpret this instruction
  and, consequently, which speed-accuracy trade-off they choose might vary between
  experiments, between participants, and between conditions. Consequently, experimental
  effects can appear unpredictably in either RTs or error rates~(i.e., accuracy).
  Even more problematic, spurious effects might emerge that are actually due only
  to differential speed-accuracy trade-offs. An often-suggested solution is the inverse
  efficiency score (IES; Townsend & Ashby, 1983), which combines speed and accuracy
  into a single score. Alternatives are the rate-correct score (RCS; Woltz & Was,
  2006) and the linear-integrated speed-accuracy score (LISAS; Vandierendonck, 2017,
  2018). We report analyses on simulated data generated with the standard diffusion
  model (Ratcliff, 1978) showing that IES, RCS, and LISAS put unequal weights on speed
  and accuracy, depending on the accuracy level, and that these measures are actually
  very sensitive to speed-accuracy trade-offs. These findings stand in contrast to
  a fourth alternative, the balanced integration score (BIS; Liesefeld, Fu, & Zimmer,
  2015), which was devised to integrate speed and accuracy with equal weights. Although
  all of the measures maintain \"real\" effects, only BIS is relatively insensitive
  to speed-accuracy trade-offs.
