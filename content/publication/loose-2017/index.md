abstract: Alternating between two tasks is effortful and impairs performance. Previous
  fMRI studies have found increased activity in frontoparietal cortex when task switching
  is required. One possibility is that the additional control demands for switch trials
  are met by strengthening task representations in the human brain. Alternatively,
  on switch trials, the residual representation of the previous task might impede
  the buildup of a neural task representation. This would predict weaker task representations
  on switch trials, thus also explaining the performance costs. To test this, male
  and female participants were cued to perform one of two similar tasks, with the
  task being repeated or switched between successive trials. Multivoxel pattern analysis
  was used to test which regions encode the tasks and whether this encoding differs
  between switch and repeat trials. As expected, we found information about task representations
  in frontal and parietal cortex, but there was no difference in the decoding accuracy
  of task-related information between switch and repeat trials. Using cross-classification,
  we found that the frontoparietal cortex encodes tasks using a generalizable spatial
  pattern in switch and repeat trials. Therefore, task representations in frontal
  and parietal cortex are largely switch independent. We found no evidence that neural
  information about task representations in these regions can explain behavioral costs
  usually associated with task switching.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Alternating between
  two tasks is effortful and slows down performance. One possible explanation is that
  the representations in the human brain need time to build up and are thus weaker
  on switch trials, explaining performance costs. Alternatively, task representations
  might even be enhanced to overcome the previous task. Here, we used a combination
  of fMRI and a brain classifier to test whether the additional control demands under
  switching conditions lead to an increased or decreased strength of task representations
  in frontoparietal brain regions. We found that task representations are not modulated
  significantly by switching processes and generalize across switching conditions.
  Therefore, task representations in the human brain cannot account for the performance
  costs associated with alternating between tasks.
