abstract: 'Multivariate decoding methods were developed originally as tools to enable
  accurate predictions in real-world applications. The realization that these methods
  can also be employed to study brain function has led to their widespread adoption
  in the neurosciences. However, prior to the rise of multivariate decoding, the study
  of brain function was firmly embedded in a statistical philosophy grounded on univariate
  methods of data analysis. In this way, multivariate decoding for brain interpretation
  grew out of two established frameworks: multivariate decoding for predictions in
  real-world applications, and classical univariate analysis based on the study and
  interpretation of brain activation. We argue that this led to two confusions, one
  reflecting a mixture of multivariate decoding for prediction or interpretation,
  and the other a mixture of the conceptual and statistical philosophies underlying
  multivariate decoding and classical univariate analysis. Here we attempt to systematically
  disambiguate multivariate decoding for the study of brain function from the frameworks
  it grew out of. After elaborating these confusions and their consequences, we describe
  six, often unappreciated, differences between classical univariate analysis and
  multivariate decoding. We then focus on how the common interpretation of what is
  signal and noise changes in multivariate decoding. Finally, we use four examples
  to illustrate where these confusions may impact the interpretation of neuroimaging
  data. We conclude with a discussion of potential strategies to help resolve these
  confusions in interpreting multivariate decoding results, including the potential
  departure from multivariate decoding methods for the study of brain function.'
