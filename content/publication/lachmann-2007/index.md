abstract: We adopted the Psychological Refractoriness Paradigm to study whether perceptual
  Goodness affects the load of central processing resources. In three dual-task experiments,
  2-Alternative Forced Choice auditory classification was followed by a same-different
  task in which Garner's classical five-dot patterns were presented. Goodness of these
  patterns and stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) between the first and second task were
  varied between trials. These factors had additive effects on response latencies
  and accuracy, indicating that pattern Goodness determines central processing load
  in performing the same-different task. In a fourth experiment, same-different judgment
  with Garner patterns was the single task. SOA between the first and second pattern
  was varied. Over-additive effects of Goodness with decreasing SOA were obtained,
  indicating sharing of central resources between consolidation of the first Garner
  pattern and performing the same-different task. Whereas, the resources needed for
  the latter, again, depend on Goodness, those needed for consolidation are independent
  of it.
