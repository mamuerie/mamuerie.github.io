 abstract = {We adopted the Psychological Refractoriness Paradigm to study whether perceptual Goodness affects the load of central processing resources. In three dual-task experiments, 2-Alternative Forced Choice auditory classification was followed by a same-different task in which Garner's classical five-dot patterns were presented. Goodness of these patterns and stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) between the first and second task were varied between trials. These factors had additive effects on response latencies and accuracy, indicating that pattern Goodness determines central processing load in performing the same-different task. In a fourth experiment, same-different judgment with Garner patterns was the single task. SOA between the first and second pattern was varied. Over-additive effects of Goodness with decreasing SOA were obtained, indicating sharing of central resources between consolidation of the first Garner pattern and performing the same-different task. Whereas, the resources needed for the latter, again, depend on Goodness, those needed for consolidation are independent of it.},
