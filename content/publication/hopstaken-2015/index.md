abstract: Mental fatigue is often characterized by reduced motivation for effortful
  activity and impaired task performance. We used subjective, behavioral (performance),
  and psychophysiological (P3, pupil diameter) measures during an n-back task to investigate
  the link between mental fatigue and task disengagement. After 2,h, we manipulated
  the rewards to examine a possible reengagement effect. Analyses showed that, with
  increasing fatigue and time-on-task, performance, P3 amplitude, and pupil diameter
  decreased. After increasing the rewards, all measures reverted to higher levels.
  Multilevel analysis revealed positive correlations between the used measures with
  time-on-task. We interpret these results as support for a strong link between task
  disengagement and mental fatigue.
