abstract: 'The psychological refractory period (PRP) refers to the fact that humans
  typically cannot perform two tasks at once. Behavioral experiments have led to the
  proposal that, in fact, peripheral perceptual and motor stages continue to operate
  in parallel, and that only a central decision stage imposes a serial bottleneck.
  We tested this model using neuroimaging methods combined with innovative time-sensitive
  analysis tools. Subjects performed a dual-task visual-auditory paradigm in which
  a delay of 300 ms was injected into the auditory task either within or outside of
  the dual-task interference period. Event-related potentials indicated that the first
  approximately 250 ms of processing were insensitive to dual-task interference, and
  that the PRP was mainly reflected in a delayed global component. By a clustering
  analysis based on time-resolved functional magnetic resonance imaging, we identified
  networks with qualitatively different timing properties: sensory areas tracked the
  objective time of stimulus presentation, a bilateral parietoprefrontal network correlated
  with the PRP delay, and an extended bilateral network that included bilateral posterior
  parietal cortex, premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, anterior part of the
  insula, and cerebellum was shared by both tasks during the extent of dual-task performance.
  The results provide physiological evidence for the coexistence of serial and parallel
  processes within a cognitive task.'
