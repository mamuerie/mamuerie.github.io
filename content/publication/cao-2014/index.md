abstract: 'The investigation of the brain connectome with functional magnetic resonance
  imaging (fMRI) and graph theory analyses has recently gained much popularity, but
  little is known about the robustness of these properties, in particular those derived
  from active fMRI tasks. Here, we studied the test–retest reliability of brain graphs
  calculated from 26 healthy participants with three established fMRI experiments
  (n-back working memory, emotional face-matching, resting state) and two parcellation
  schemes for node definition (AAL atlas, functional atlas proposed by Power et al.).
  We compared the intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) of five different data
  processing strategies and demonstrated a superior reliability of task-regression
  methods with condition-specific regressors. The between-task comparison revealed
  significantly higher ICCs for resting state relative to the active tasks, and a
  superiority of the n-back task relative to the face-matching task for global and
  local network properties. While the mean ICCs were typically lower for the active
  tasks, overall fair to good reliabilities were detected for global and local connectivity
  properties, and for the n-back task with both atlases, smallworldness. For all three
  tasks and atlases, low mean ICCs were seen for the local network properties. However,
  node-specific good reliabilities were detected for node degree in regions known
  to be critical for the challenged functions (resting-state: default-mode network
  nodes, n-back: fronto-parietal nodes, face-matching: limbic nodes). Between-atlas
  comparison demonstrated significantly higher reliabilities for the functional parcellations
  for global and local network properties. Our findings can inform the choice of processing
  strategies, brain atlases and outcome properties for fMRI studies using active tasks,
  graph theory methods, and within-subject designs, in particular future pharmaco-fMRI
  studies.'
