abstract: 'UNLABELLED The dual n-back working memory (WM) training paradigm (comprising
  auditory and visual stimuli) has gained much attention since studies have shown
  widespread transfer effects. By including a multimodal dual-task component, the
  task is demanding to the human cognitive system. We investigated whether dual n-back
  training improves general cognitive resources or a task-specific WM updating process
  in participants. We expected: (1) widespread transfer effects and the recruitment
  of a common neuronal network by the training and the transfer tasks and (2) narrower
  transfer results and that a common activation network alone would not produce transfer,
  but instead an activation focus on the striatum, which is associated with WM updating
  processes. The training group showed transfer to an untrained dual-modality WM updating
  task, but not to single-task versions of the training or the transfer task. They
  also showed diminished neuronal overlap between the training and the transfer task
  from pretest to posttest and an increase in striatal activation in both tasks. Furthermore,
  we found an association between the striatal activation increase and behavioral
  improvement. The control groups showed no transfer and no change in the amount of
  activation overlap or in striatal activation from pretest to posttest. We conclude
  that, instead of improving general cognitive resources (which would have required
  a transfer effect to all transfer tasks and that a frontal activation overlap between
  the tasks produced transfer), dual n-back training improved a task-specific process:
  WM updating of stimuli from two modalities. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The current study
  allows for a better understanding of the cognitive and neural effects of working
  memory (WM) training and transfer. It shows that dual n-back training mainly improves
  specific processes of WM updating, and this improvement leads to narrow transfer
  effects to tasks involving the same processes. On a neuronal level this is accompanied
  by increased neural activation in the striatum that is related to WM updating. The
  current findings challenge the view that dual n-back training provokes a general
  boosting of the WM system and of its neural underpinnings located in frontoparietal
  brain regions. Instead, the findings imply the relevance of task-specific brain
  regions which are involved in important cognitive processes during training and
  transfer tasks.'
