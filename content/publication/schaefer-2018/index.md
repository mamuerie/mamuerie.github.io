abstract: A central goal in systems neuroscience is the parcellation of the cerebral
  cortex into discrete neurobiological \"atoms\". Resting-state functional magnetic
  resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) offers the possibility of in vivo human cortical parcellation.
  Almost all previous parcellations relied on 1 of 2 approaches. The local gradient
  approach detects abrupt transitions in functional connectivity patterns. These transitions
  potentially reflect cortical areal boundaries defined by histology or visuotopic
  fMRI. By contrast, the global similarity approach clusters similar functional connectivity
  patterns regardless of spatial proximity, resulting in parcels with homogeneous
  (similar) rs-fMRI signals. Here, we propose a gradient-weighted Markov Random Field
  (gwMRF) model integrating local gradient and global similarity approaches. Using
  task-fMRI and rs-fMRI across diverse acquisition protocols, we found gwMRF parcellations
  to be more homogeneous than 4 previously published parcellations. Furthermore, gwMRF
  parcellations agreed with the boundaries of certain cortical areas defined using
  histology and visuotopic fMRI. Some parcels captured subareal (somatotopic and visuotopic)
  features that likely reflect distinct computational units within known cortical
  areas. These results suggest that gwMRF parcellations reveal neurobiologically meaningful
  features of brain organization and are potentially useful for future applications
  requiring dimensionality reduction of voxel-wise fMRI data. Multiresolution parcellations
  generated from 1489 participants are publicly available 
  (https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/brain_parcellation/Schaefer2018_LocalGlobal).
