abstract: This paper reviews the actual and potential benefits of a marriage between
  cognitive psychology and psychophysiology. Psychophysiological measures, particularly
  those of the event‐related brain potential, can be used as markers for psychological
  events and physiological events. Thus, they can serve as “windows’ on the mind and
  as “windows’ on the brain. These ideas are illustrated in the context of a series
  of studies utilizing the lateralized readiness potential, a measure of electrical
  brain activity that is related to preparation for movement. This measure has been
  used to illuminate presetting processes that prepare the motor system for action,
  to demonstrate the presence of the transmission of partial information in the cognitive
  system, and to identify processes responsible for the inhibition of responses. The
  lateralized readiness potential appears to reflect activity in motor areas of cortex.
  Thus, this measure, along with other psychophysiological measures, can be used to
  understand how the functions of the mind are implemented in the brain potential.
