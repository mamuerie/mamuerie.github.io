abstract: Brain connectivity datasets comprise networks of brain regions connected
  by anatomical tracts or by functional associations. Complex network analysis-a new
  multidisciplinary approach to the study of complex systems-aims to characterize
  these brain networks with a small number of neurobiologically meaningful and easily
  computable measures. In this article, we discuss construction of brain networks
  from connectivity data and describe the most commonly used network measures of structural
  and functional connectivity. We describe measures that variously detect functional
  integration and segregation, quantify centrality of individual brain regions or
  pathways, characterize patterns of local anatomical circuitry, and test resilience
  of networks to insult. We discuss the issues surrounding comparison of structural
  and functional network connectivity, as well as comparison of networks across subjects.
  Finally, we describe a Matlab toolbox (http://www.brain-connectivity-toolbox.net)
  accompanying this article and containing a collection of complex network measures
  and large-scale neuroanatomical connectivity datasets.
