abstract: This paper concerns the spatial and intensity transformations that are required
  to adjust for the confounding effects of subject movement during functional MRI
  (fMRI) activation studies. An approach is presented that models, and removes, movement-related
  artifacts from fMRI time-series. This approach is predicated on the observation
  that movement-related effects are extant even after perfect realignment. Movement-related
  effects can be divided into those that are a function of position of the object
  in the frame of reference of the scanner and those that are due to movement in previous
  scans. This second component depends on the history of excitation experienced by
  spins in a small volume and consequent differences in local saturation. The spin
  excitation history thus will itself be a function of previous positions, suggesting
  an autoregression-moving average model for the effects of previous displacements
  on the current signal. A model is described as well as the adjustments for movement-related
  components that ensue. The empirical analyses suggest that (in extreme situations)
  over 90% of fMRI signal can be attributed to movement, and that this artifactual
  component can be successfully removed.
