abstract: Independent component analysis (ICA) and blind source separation (BSS) methods
  are increasingly used to separate individual brain and non-brain source signals
  mixed by volume conduction in electroencephalographic (EEG) and other electrophysiological
  recordings. We compared results of decomposing thirteen 71-channel human scalp EEG
  datasets by 22 ICA and BSS algorithms, assessing the pairwise mutual information
  (PMI) in scalp channel pairs, the remaining PMI in component pairs, the overall
  mutual information reduction (MIR) effected by each decomposition, and decomposition
  'dipolarity' defined as the number of component scalp maps matching the projection
  of a single equivalent dipole with less than a given residual variance. The least
  well-performing algorithm was principal component analysis (PCA); best performing
  were AMICA and other likelihood/mutual information based ICA methods. Though these
  and other commonly-used decomposition methods returned many similar components,
  across 18 ICA/BSS algorithms mean dipolarity varied linearly with both MIR and with
  PMI remaining between the resulting component time courses, a result compatible
  with an interpretation of many maximally independent EEG components as being volume-conducted
  projections of partially-synchronous local cortical field activity within single
  compact cortical domains. To encourage further method comparisons, the data and
  software used to prepare the results have been made available (http://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/BSSComparison).
