abstract: In this dual-task study, we applied both cross-talk logic and locus-of-slack
  logic to test whether participants can retrieve semantic categories in Task 2 in
  parallel to Task 1 bottleneck processing. Whereas cross-talk logic can detect parallel
  memory retrieval only in conditions of categorical overlap between tasks, the locus-of-slack
  approach is independent of such restrictions. As was expected, using the cross-talk
  logic, we found clear evidence for parallel retrieval of semantic categories when
  there was categorical overlap between tasks (Experiment 1). Locus-of-slack-based
  evidence for parallel semantic retrieval was found, however, both in conditions
  with (Experiment 1) and in those without (Experiment 2) categorical overlap between
  tasks. Crucially,however, increasing the demand for resources required to switch
  from Task 1 to Task 2 eliminated even the locus-of-slack-based evidence for parallel
  memory retrieval during the psychological refractory period (Experiment 3). Together,
  our results suggest that parallel retrieval is not bound to conditions of categorical
  overlap between tasks but, instead, is contingent upon resources needed for switching
  between tasks (e.g., Oriet, Tombu, & Jolicoeur, 2005).
