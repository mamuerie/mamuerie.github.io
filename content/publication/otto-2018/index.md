abstract: Investing mental effort is costly, and the investment has to be matched
  by a reward to make a person engage in task performance. However, the neural structures
  underlying the continued management of mental effort are not known. Previous work
  has identified left-lateralized structures, most prominently the left anterior Insular
  Cortex (aIC) as regions implied in post-hoc evaluation and also anticipation of
  mental effort investment. We present a study aimed at identifying neural structures
  that are sensitive to changes in both task load and fatigue-induced state load.
  Sixteen healthy participants performed an n-back task before and after a fatigue-inducing
  day in a helicopter simulator or a free day. Subjective mental effort ratings showed
  an interaction of the effects of both task and state load changes, with a reduced
  effect of task load during the fatigued state. Testing for the same interaction
  effect in a whole-brain functional MRI data, we found a left-lateralized group of
  clusters in aIC, the anterior cingulate cortex, the dorsal striatum and frontal
  eye field and M1. We discuss the possible role of these areas and also the relevance
  of our findings in the light of the proposed opportunity cost model of mental effort.
