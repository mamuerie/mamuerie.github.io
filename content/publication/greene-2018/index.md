abstract: Recent work has begun to relate individual differences in brain functional
  organization to human behaviors and cognition, but the best brain state to reveal
  such relationships remains an open question. In two large, independent data sets,
  we here show that cognitive tasks amplify trait-relevant individual differences
  in patterns of functional connectivity, such that predictive models built from task
  fMRI data outperform models built from resting-state fMRI data. Further, certain
  tasks consistently yield better predictions of fluid intelligence than others, and
  the task that generates the best-performing models varies by sex. By~considering
  task-induced brain state and sex, the best-performing model explains over 20% of
  the variance in fluid intelligence scores, as compared to $<$6% of variance explained
  by rest-based models. This suggests that identifying and inducing the right brain
  state in a given group can better reveal brain-behavior relationships, motivating
  a paradigm shift from rest- to task-based functional connectivity analyses.
