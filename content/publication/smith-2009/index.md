abstract: Neural connections, providing the substrate for functional networks, exist
  whether or not they are functionally active at any given moment. However, it is
  not known to what extent brain regions are continuously interacting when the brain
  is \"at rest.\" In this work, we identify the major explicit activation networks
  by carrying out an image-based activation network analysis of thousands of separate
  activation maps derived from the BrainMap database of functional imaging studies,
  involving nearly 30,000 human subjects. Independently, we extract the major covarying
  networks in the resting brain, as imaged with functional magnetic resonance imaging
  in 36 subjects at rest. The sets of major brain networks, and their decompositions
  into subnetworks, show close correspondence between the independent analyses of
  resting and activation brain dynamics. We conclude that the full repertoire of functional
  networks utilized by the brain in action is continuously and dynamically \"active\"
  even when at \"rest.\"
