abstract: Typically, in task-switching contexts individuals are slower and less accurate
  when repeating a task in mixed blocks compared to single-task blocks (mixing cost)
  and when switching to a new task compared to repeating a previous one (switch cost).
  Previous research has shown that distinct electrophysiological correlates underlie
  these two phenomena. However, this evidence is not a consistent result. The goal
  of this study was to better characterize differences between the control processes
  involved in mixing and switch costs. To this aim, we examined event-related potentials
  (ERPs) evoked during a cued task-switching experiment. In order to minimize the
  confounding effects of cognitive demands unrelated to task-switching, we asked participants
  to shift between two simple tasks (a letter identity task and a letter position
  task). The mixing cost was defined, in terms of ERPs, by contrasting repeat and
  single-task trials, whereas the ERP switch cost was obtained from the comparison
  of switch and repeat trials. Cue-locked ERPs showed that the mixing cost was mediated
  by two sustained components, an early posterior positivity and a late anterior negativity.
  On the other hand, the switch cost was associated with two early phasic positive
  components, one principally distributed over centro-parietal sites and the other
  located over left posterior sites. In target-locked ERPs the mixing cost was expressed
  by a frontal positivity, whereas the switch cost was expressed by a reduced parietal
  P3b. Overall, the results extend previous findings by providing elucidating ERP
  evidence on distinct proactive and reactive control processes involved in mixing
  and switch costs.
