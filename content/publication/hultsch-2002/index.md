abstract: 'Age differences in three basic types of variability were examined: variability
  between persons (diversity), variability within persons across tasks (dispersion),
  and variability within persons across time (inconsistency). Measures of variability
  were based on latency performance from four measures of reaction time (RT) performed
  by a total of 99 younger adults (ages 17--36 years) and 763 older adults (ages 54--94
  years). Results indicated that all three types of variability were greater in older
  compared with younger participants even when group differences in speed were statistically
  controlled. Quantile-quantile plots showed age and task differences in the shape
  of the inconsistency distributions. Measures of within-person variability (dispersion
  and inconsistency) were positively correlated. Individual differences in RT inconsistency
  correlated negatively with level of performance on measures of perceptual speed,
  working memory, episodic memory, and crystallized abilities. Partial set correlation
  analyses indicated that inconsistency predicted cognitive performance independent
  of level of performance. The results indicate that variability of performance is
  an important indicator of cognitive functioning and aging.'
