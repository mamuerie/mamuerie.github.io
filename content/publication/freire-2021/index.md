abstract: Social scientists are awash with new data sources. Though data preprocessing
  and storage methods have developed considerably over the past few years, there is
  little agreement on what constitutes the best set of data validation practices in
  the social sciences. In this paper I provide five simple steps that can help students
  and practitioners improve their data validation processes. I discuss how to create
  testable validation functions, how to increase construct validity, and how to incorporate
  qualitative knowledge in statistical measurements. I present the concepts according
  to their level of abstraction, and I provide practical examples on how scholars
  can add my suggestions to their work.
