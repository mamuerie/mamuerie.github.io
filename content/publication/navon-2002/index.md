abstract: The model of a single central bottleneck for human information processing
  is critically examined. Most evidence cited in support of the model has been observed
  within the overlapping tasks paradigm. It is shown here that most findings obtained
  within that paradigm and that were used to support the model are also consistent
  with a simple resource model. The most prominent findings are the millisecond-for-millisecond
  slope at the left of the RT2-SOA curve, the high RT1-RT2 correlation, the additivity
  of the effects on RT2 of SOA and of the difficulty of selecting R2, and the washout
  of the effect of S2 discriminability on RT2 in a dual-task condition. In addition,
  the asymmetry of the effects of the dual-task requirement on RT1 and RT2 can be
  accounted for by the resource model provided that it assumes uneven allocation of
  resources, which is quite reasonable in view of the task asymmetry inherent in the
  demand characteristics of the paradigm. The same is true for two other findings
  that appear to support the single-bottleneck model-that in the dual-task condition,
  the demand of the first task affects equally RT1 and RT2 and that its effect on
  RT1 is the same as the corresponding effect in the single-task condition. Furthermore,
  the single-bottleneck model is hard to reconcile with a negative slope at the left
  of the RT1-SOA curve or a positive slope at the left of the IRI-SOA curve, unless
  augmented by ancillary assumptions that are yet to be substantiated. Representative
  data were fit by each of the models using its optimal set of parameters. Both models
  achieved quite good degrees of fit. It is further argued that since the overlapping
  tasks paradigm is heavily biased in favor of a speedy reaction to the stimulus that
  appears first, it is nonoptimal for testing the central bottleneck model. Finally,
  the bottleneck model is examined in terms of other scientific criteria.
