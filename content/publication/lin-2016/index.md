abstract: Characterization of the default mode network (DMN) as a complex network
  of functionally interacting dynamic systems has received great interest for the
  study of DMN neural mechanisms. In particular, understanding the relationship of
  intrinsic resting-state DMN brain network with cognitive behaviors is an important
  issue in healthy cognition and mental disorders. However, it is still unclear how
  DMN functional connectivity links to cognitive behaviors during resting-state. In
  this study, we hypothesize that static and dynamic DMN nodal topology is associated
  with upcoming cognitive task performance. We used graph theory analysis in order
  to understand better the relationship between the DMN functional connectivity and
  cognitive behavior during resting-state and task performance. Nodal degree of the
  DMN was calculated as a metric of network topology. We found that the static and
  dynamic posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) nodal degree within the DMN was associated
  with task performance (Reaction Time). Our results show that the core node PCC nodal
  degree within the DMN was significantly correlated with reaction time, which suggests
  that the PCC plays a key role in supporting cognitive function.
