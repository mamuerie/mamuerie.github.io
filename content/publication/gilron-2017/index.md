abstract: Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) has gained enormous popularity in the
  neuroimaging community over the past few years. At the group level, most MVPA studies
  adopt an \"information based\" approach in which the sign of the effect of individual
  subjects is discarded and a non-directional summary statistic is carried over to
  the second level. This is in contrast to a directional \"activation based\" approach
  typical in univariate group level analysis, in which both signal magnitude and sign
  are taken into account. The transition from examining effects in one voxel at a
  time vs. several voxels (univariate vs. multivariate) has thus tacitly entailed
  a transition from directional to non-directional signal definition at the group
  level. While a directional group-level MVPA approach implies that individuals have
  similar multivariate spatial patterns of activity, in a non-directional approach
  each individual may have a distinct spatial pattern. Using an experimental dataset,
  we show that directional and non-directional group-level MVPA approaches uncover
  distinct brain regions with only partial overlap. We propose a method to quantify
  the degree of spatial similarity in activation patterns over subjects. Applied to
  an auditory task, we find higher values in auditory regions compared to control
  regions.
