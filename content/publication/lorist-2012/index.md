abstract: In this study we sought to elucidate what mechanisms underlie the effects
  of trial history on information processing. We explicitly focused on the contribution
  of conflict control and S-R binding to sequential trial effects. Performance and
  brain activity were measured during two hours of continuous Stroop task performance.
  Mental fatigue, known to influence top-down processing, was used to elucidate separate
  effects via top-down and bottom-up mechanisms. Here we confirm that performance
  in the Stroop task is indeed strongly modulated by stimulus history. Performance
  was affected by the kind of advance information available; dependent on this information
  adjustments were made, resulting in differential effects of cognitive conflict,
  and S-R binding on subsequent performance. The influence of mental fatigue on information
  processing was mainly related to general effects on attention.
