 abstract = {In this study we sought to elucidate what mechanisms underlie the effects of trial history on information processing. We explicitly focused on the contribution of conflict control and S-R binding to sequential trial effects. Performance and brain activity were measured during two hours of continuous Stroop task performance. Mental fatigue, known to influence top-down processing, was used to elucidate separate effects via top-down and bottom-up mechanisms. Here we confirm that performance in the Stroop task is indeed strongly modulated by stimulus history. Performance was affected by the kind of advance information available; dependent on this information adjustments were made, resulting in differential effects of cognitive conflict, and S-R binding on subsequent performance. The influence of mental fatigue on information processing was mainly related to general effects on attention.},
