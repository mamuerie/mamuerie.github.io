abstract: People aim to produce effects in the environment, and according to ideomotor
  theory, actions are selected and executed via anticipations of their effects. Further,
  to ensure that an action has been successful and an effect has been realized, we
  must be able to monitor the consequences of our actions. However, action-effect
  links might vary between situations, some might apply for a majority of situations,
  while others might only apply to special occasions. With a combination of behavioral
  and electrophysiological markers, we show that monitoring of self-produced action
  effects interferes with other tasks, and that the length of effect monitoring is
  determined by both, long-term action-effect links that hold for most situations,
  and short-term action-effect links that emerge from a current setting. Effect monitoring
  is fast and frugal when these action-effect links allow for valid anticipation of
  action effects, but otherwise effect monitoring takes longer and delays a subsequent
  task. Specific influences of long-term and short-term links on the P1/N1 and P3a
  further allow to dissect the temporal dynamics of when these links interact for
  the purpose of effect monitoring. (PsycINFO Database Record
