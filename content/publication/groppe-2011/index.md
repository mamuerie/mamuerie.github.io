abstract: 'Event-related potentials (ERPs) and magnetic fields (ERFs) are typically
  analyzed via ANOVAs on mean activity in a priori windows. Advances in computing
  power and statistics have produced an alternative, mass univariate analyses consisting
  of thousands of statistical tests and powerful corrections for multiple comparisons.
  Such analyses are most useful when one has little a priori knowledge of effect locations
  or latencies, and for delineating effect boundaries. Mass univariate analyses complement
  and, at times, obviate traditional analyses. Here we review this approach as applied
  to ERP/ERF data and four methods for multiple comparison correction: strong control
  of the familywise error rate (FWER) via permutation tests, weak control of FWER
  via cluster-based permutation tests, false discovery rate control, and control of
  the generalized FWER. We end with recommendations for their use and introduce free
  MATLAB software for their implementation.'
