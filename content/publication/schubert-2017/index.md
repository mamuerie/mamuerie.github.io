abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that dual-task performance with two simultaneously
  presented tasks can be substantially improved as a result of practice. Among other
  mechanisms, theories of dual-task practice-relate this improvement to the acquisition
  of task coordination skills. These skills are assumed (1) to result from dual-task
  practice, but not from single-task practice, and (2) to be independent from the
  specific stimulus and response mappings during the practice situation and, therefore,
  transferable to new dual task situations. The present study is the first that provides
  an elaborated test of these assumptions in a context with well-controllable practice
  and transfer situations. To this end, we compared the effects of dual-task and single-task
  practice with a visual and an auditory sensory-motor component task on the dual-task
  performance in a subsequent transfer session. Importantly, stimulus and stimulus-response
  mapping conditions in the two component tasks changed repeatedly during practice
  sessions, which prevents that automatized stimulus-response associations may be
  transferred from practice to transfer. Dual-task performance was found to be improved
  after practice with the dual tasks in contrast to the single-task practice. These
  findings are consistent with the assumption that coordination skills had been acquired,
  which can be transferred to other dual-task situations independently on the specific
  stimulus and response mapping conditions of the practiced component tasks.
