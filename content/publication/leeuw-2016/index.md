abstract: Behavioral researchers are increasingly using Web-based software such as
  JavaScript to conduct response time experiments. Although there has been some research
  on the accuracy and reliability of response time measurements collected using JavaScript,
  it remains unclear how well this method performs relative to standard laboratory
  software in psychologically relevant experimental manipulations. Here we present
  results from a visual search experiment in which we measured response time distributions
  with both Psychophysics Toolbox (PTB) and JavaScript. We developed a methodology
  that allowed us to simultaneously run the visual search experiment with both systems,
  interleaving trials between two independent computers, thus minimizing the effects
  of factors other than the experimental software. The response times measured by
  JavaScript were approximately 25~ms longer than those measured by PTB. However,
  we found no reliable difference in the variability of the distributions related
  to the software, and both software packages were equally sensitive to changes in
  the response times as a result of the experimental manipulations. We concluded that
  JavaScript is a suitable tool for measuring response times in behavioral research.
