abstract: Our ability to effectively adapt to novel circumstances--as measured by
  general fluid intelligence--has recently been tied to the global connectivity of
  lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC). Global connectivity is a broad measure that summarizes
  both within-network connectivity and across-network connectivity. We used additional
  graph theoretical measures to better characterize the nature of LPFC connectivity
  and its relationship with fluid intelligence. We specifically hypothesized that
  LPFC is a connector hub with an across-network connectivity that contributes to
  fluid intelligence independent of within-network connectivity. We verified that
  LPFC was in the top 10% of brain regions in terms of across-network connectivity,
  suggesting it is a strong connector hub. Importantly, we found that the LPFC across-network
  connectivity predicted individuals' fluid intelligence and this correlation remained
  statistically significant when controlling for global connectivity (which includes
  within-network connectivity). This supports the conclusion that across-network connectivity
  independently contributes to the relationship between LPFC connectivity and intelligence.
  These results suggest that LPFC contributes to fluid intelligence by being a connector
  hub with a truly global multisystem connectivity throughout the brain.
