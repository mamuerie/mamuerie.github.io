abstract: Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) is a relatively recent innovation in
  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods. MVPA is increasingly widely
  used, as it is apparently more effective than classical general linear model analysis
  (GLMA) for detecting response patterns or representations that are distributed at
  a fine spatial scale. However, we demonstrate that widely used approaches to MVPA
  can systematically admit certain confounds that are appropriately eliminated by
  GLMA. Thus confounds rather than distributed representations may explain some cases
  in which MVPA produced positive results but GLMA did not. The issue is that it is
  common practice in MVPA to conduct group tests on single-subject summary statistics
  that discard the sign or direction of underlying effects, whereas GLMA group tests
  are conducted directly on single-subject effects themselves. We describe how this
  common MVPA practice undermines standard experiment design logic that is intended
  to control at the group level for certain types of confounds, such as time on task
  and individual differences. Furthermore, we note that a simple application of linear
  regression can restore experimental control when using MVPA in many situations.
  Finally, we present a case study with novel fMRI data in the domain of rule representations,
  or flexible stimulus-response mappings, which has seen several recent MVPA publications.
  In our new dataset, as with recent reports, standard MVPA appears to reveal rule
  representations in prefrontal cortex regions, whereas GLMA produces null results.
  However, controlling for a variable that is confounded with rule at the individual-subject
  level but not the group level (reaction time differences across rules) eliminates
  the MVPA results. This raises the question of whether recently reported results
  truly reflect rule representations, or rather the effects of confounds such as reaction
  time, difficulty, or other variables of no interest.
