abstract: Several brain areas show signal decreases during many different cognitive
  tasks in functional imaging studies, including the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)
  and a medial frontal region incorporating portions of the medial frontal gyrus and
  ventral anterior cingulate cortex (MFG/vACC). It has been suggested that these areas
  are components in a default mode network that is engaged during rest and disengaged
  during cognitive tasks. This study investigated the functional connectivity between
  the PCC and MFG/vACC during a working memory task and at rest by examining temporal
  correlations in magnetic resonance signal levels between the regions. The two regions
  were functionally connected in both conditions. In addition, performance on the
  working memory task was positively correlated with the strength of this functional
  connection not only during the working memory task, but also at rest. Thus, it appears
  these regions are components of a network that may facilitate or monitor cognitive
  performance, rather than becoming disengaged during cognitive tasks. In addition,
  these data raise the possibility that the individual differences in coupling strength
  between these two regions at rest predict differences in cognitive abilities important
  for this working memory task.
