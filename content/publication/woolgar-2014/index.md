abstract: "Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) is a sensitive and increasingly popular
  method for examining differences between neural activation patterns that cannot
  be detected using classical mass-univariate analysis. Recently, Todd et al. (\\\"\
  Confounds in multivariate pattern analysis: Theory and rule representation case
  study\\\", 2013, NeuroImage 77: 157-165) highlighted a potential problem for these
  methods: high sensitivity to confounds at the level of individual participants due
  to the use of directionless summary statistics. Unlike traditional mass-univariate
  analyses where confounding activation differences in opposite directions tend to
  approximately average out at group level, group level MVPA results may be driven
  by any activation differences that can be discriminated in individual participants.
  In Todd et al.'s empirical data, factoring out differences in reaction time (RT)
  reduced a classifier's ability to distinguish patterns of activation pertaining
  to two task rules. This raises two significant questions for the field: to what
  extent have previous multivoxel discriminations in the literature been driven by
  RT differences, and by what methods should future studies take RT and other confounds
  into account? We build on the work of Todd et al. and compare two different approaches
  to remove the effect of RT in MVPA. We show that in our empirical data, in contrast
  to that of Todd et al., the effect of RT on rule decoding is negligible, and results
  were not affected by the specific details of RT modelling. We discuss the meaning
  of and sensitivity for confounds in traditional and multivoxel approaches to fMRI
  analysis. We observe that the increased sensitivity of MVPA comes at a price of
  reduced specificity, meaning that these methods in particular call for careful consideration
  of what differs between our conditions of interest. We conclude that the additional
  complexity of the experimental design, analysis and interpretation needed for MVPA
  is still not a reason to favour a less sensitive approach."
