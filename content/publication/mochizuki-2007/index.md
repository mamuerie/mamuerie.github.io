abstract: Several functional imaging studies have demonstrated the importance of fronto-parietal
  network in dual-task management. However, neural correlates underlying the difference
  in intensity of dual-task interference between the same and different response modalities
  remain unknown. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between brain activity
  associated with dual-task management and the combinations of response modalities.
  We used the dual-task requiring bilateral finger responses (DT-same condition) and
  that requiring finger and oral responses (DT-different condition) to visual and
  auditory stimuli. The right premotor cortex, precuneus and right posterior parietal
  cortex were significantly activated in the DT-same condition. The neural activities
  in the right premotor cortex significantly correlated to the delayed responses in
  the DT-same condition relative to the single-task conditions, indicating that the
  right premotor cortex is partly associated with dual-task management (i.e., the
  regulation of information flow). In addition, neural activity in this brain region
  was significantly higher in the DT-same condition than in the DT-different condition,
  suggesting that the difference in intensity between the same and different response
  modalities is partly associated with difference in the load on the premotor cortex
  between the DT-same and DT-different conditions. The significant activation of the
  parietal cortex also differed between the DT-same and DT-different conditions. These
  results demonstrate that brain activity associated with dual-task management differs
  depending on the combination of response modalities and that such a difference in
  brain activity, particularly in the right premotor cortex, might be partly associated
  with the difference in intensity of dual-task interference between the DT-same and
  DT-different conditions.
