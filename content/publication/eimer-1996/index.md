abstract: Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during visual discrimination
  tasks in which stimulus arrays were presented that contained one lateral target
  and 3 (experiment 1) or one (experiments 2 and 3) non-targets. In experiments 1
  and 2, targets differed from non-targets with respect to their form or their color.
  In experiment 3, word pairs were presented, with targets differing from non-targets
  with respect to their content. Subjects were required to respond to the identity
  of the target. In all experiments, an enhanced negativity was elicited at posterior
  electrodes contralateral to the location of the target. In the form discrimination
  tasks, this effect was present in the N1, N2 and P3 time intervals. In the color
  discrimination tasks, it was confined to the N2 time range. In the word discrimination
  task (experiment 3), this effect could only be observed over the left posterior
  himsphere. It is argued that these laterized negativities reflect the N2pc component
  that is assumed to indicat attentional filterin processes during visual search tasks.
  The present results extend this assumption by showing that this component is also
  elicited when targets are presented together with just one non-target item. It is
  argued that the N2pc may reflect the attentional selection of task-relevant stimuli.
