abstract: 'Resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is an imaging technique that allows
  the spontaneous activity of the brain to be measured. Measures of functional connectivity
  highly depend on the quality of the BOLD signal data processing. In this study,
  our aim was to study the influence of preprocessing steps and their order of application
  on small-world topology and their efficiency in resting state fMRI data analysis
  using graph theory. We applied the most standard preprocessing steps: slice-timing,
  realign, smoothing, filtering, and the tCompCor method. In particular, we were interested
  in how preprocessing can retain the small-world economic properties and how to maximize
  the local and global efficiency of a network while minimizing the cost. Tests that
  we conducted in 54 healthy subjects showed that the choice and ordering of preprocessing
  steps impacted the graph measures. We found that the csr (where we applied realignment,
  smoothing, and tCompCor as a final step) and the scr (where we applied realignment,
  tCompCor and smoothing as a final step) strategies had the highest mean values of
  global efficiency (eg) . Furthermore, we found that the fscr strategy (where we
  applied realignment, tCompCor, smoothing, and filtering as a final step), had the
  highest mean local efficiency (el) values. These results confirm that the graph
  theory measures of functional connectivity depend on the ordering of the processing
  steps, with the best results being obtained using smoothing and tCompCor as the
  final steps for global efficiency with additional filtering for local efficiency.'
