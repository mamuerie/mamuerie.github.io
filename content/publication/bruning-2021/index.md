abstract: Recent investigation of individual differences in multitasking revealed
  evidence for individual preferences for modes of task processing (serial vs. overlapping)
  in a task switching with preview (TSWP) paradigm and different strategies of response
  organization (blocking, switching, and response grouping) in a free concurrent dual-tasking
  (FCDT) paradigm. However, this research on individual differences at the levels
  of cognitive task processing and behavioral response organization has been pursued
  separately, thus far, by testing independent samples of participants. In the current
  study, we investigated whether these two levels of task coordination were linked
  intra-individually. As individuals preferring an overlapping task processing mode
  can generate time gains particularly at~task switches, we predicted that they prefer
  a switching strategy of response organization. In contrast, individuals preferring
  a serial processing mode are expected to prefer a blocking strategy to reduce dual-task
  demands. These predictions were confirmed in an experiment based on n,=,70 participants.
  Indeed, most serial processors preferred a blocking strategy, whereas overlapping
  processors predominantly preferred to switch between the tasks. This finding suggests
  a strong correspondence between individual preferences emerging in both aspects
  of task coordination, which might reflect a common basic difference in the preferred
  style of cognitive control (flexible vs. persistent). Moreover, in case the preferred
  modes of task processing and strategies of response organization did not correspond
  to each other, the overall multitasking efficiency was comparably low. Thus, the
  distinction between the preferences for both aspects of multitasking seems to be
  an important aspect of understanding multitasking performance and should be considered
  in future studies.
