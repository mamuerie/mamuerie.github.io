abstract: 'Fatigue is defined as a decline in the ability and efficiency of mental
  and/or physical activities that is caused by excessive mental and/or physical activities.
  Fatigue can be classified as physical or mental. Mental fatigue manifests as potentially
  impaired cognitive function and is one of the most significant causes of accidents
  in modern society. Recently, it has been shown that the neural mechanisms of mental
  fatigue related to cognitive task performance are more complex than previously thought
  and that mental fatigue is not caused only by impaired activity in task-related
  brain regions. There is accumulating evidence supporting the existence of mental
  facilitation and inhibition systems. These systems are involved in the neural mechanisms
  of mental fatigue, modulating the activity of task-related brain regions to regulate
  cognitive task performance. In this review, we propose a new conceptual model: the
  dual regulation system of mental fatigue. This model contributes to our understanding
  of the neural mechanisms of mental fatigue and the regulatory mechanisms of cognitive
  task performance in the presence of mental fatigue.'
