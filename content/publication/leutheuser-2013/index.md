abstract: Electromyogenic or muscle artifacts constitute a major problem in studies
  involving electroencephalography (EEG) measurements. This is because the rather
  low signal activity of the brain is overlaid by comparably high signal activity
  of muscles, especially neck muscles. Hence, recording an artifact-free EEG signal
  during movement or physical exercise is not, to the best knowledge of the authors,
  feasible at the moment. Nevertheless, EEG measurements are used in a variety of
  different fields like diagnosing epilepsy and other brain related diseases or in
  biofeedback for athletes. Muscle artifacts can be recorded using electromyography
  (EMG). Various computational methods for the reduction of muscle artifacts in EEG
  data exist like the ICA algorithm InfoMax and the AMICA algorithm. However, there
  exists no objective measure to compare different algorithms concerning their performance
  on EEG data. We defined a test protocol with specific neck and body movements and
  measured EEG and EMG simultaneously to compare the InfoMax algorithm and the AMICA
  algorithm. A novel objective measure enabled to compare both algorithms according
  to their performance. Results showed that the AMICA algorithm outperformed the InfoMax
  algorithm. In further research, we will continue using the established objective
  measure to test the performance of other algorithms for the reduction of artifacts.
