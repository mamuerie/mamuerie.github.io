 abstract = {Electromyogenic or muscle artifacts constitute a major problem in studies involving electroencephalography (EEG) measurements. This is because the rather low signal activity of the brain is overlaid by comparably high signal activity of muscles, especially neck muscles. Hence, recording an artifact-free EEG signal during movement or physical exercise is not, to the best knowledge of the authors, feasible at the moment. Nevertheless, EEG measurements are used in a variety of different fields like diagnosing epilepsy and other brain related diseases or in biofeedback for athletes. Muscle artifacts can be recorded using electromyography (EMG). Various computational methods for the reduction of muscle artifacts in EEG data exist like the ICA algorithm InfoMax and the AMICA algorithm. However, there exists no objective measure to compare different algorithms concerning their performance on EEG data. We defined a test protocol with specific neck and body movements and measured EEG and EMG simultaneously to compare the InfoMax algorithm and the AMICA algorithm. A novel objective measure enabled to compare both algorithms according to their performance. Results showed that the AMICA algorithm outperformed the InfoMax algorithm. In further research, we will continue using the established objective measure to test the performance of other algorithms for the reduction of artifacts.},
