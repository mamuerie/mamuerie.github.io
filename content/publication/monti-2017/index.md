abstract: An exciting avenue of neuroscientific research involves quantifying the
  time-varying properties of functional connectivity networks. As a result, many methods
  have been proposed to estimate the dynamic properties of such networks. However,
  one of the challenges associated with such methods involves the interpretation and
  visualization of high-dimensional, dynamic networks. In this work, we employ graph
  embedding algorithms to provide low-dimensional vector representations of networks,
  thus facilitating traditional objectives such as visualization, interpretation and
  classification. We focus on linear graph embedding methods based on principal component
  analysis and regularized linear discriminant analysis. The proposed graph embedding
  methods are validated through a series of simulations and applied to fMRI data from
  the Human Connectome Project.
