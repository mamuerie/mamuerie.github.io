abstract: Older adults exhibit impaired cognitive and balance performance, particularly
  under multi-task conditions, which can be improved through training. Compatibility
  of modality mappings in cognitive tasks (i.e., match between stimulus modality and
  anticipated sensory effects of motor responses), modulates physical and cognitive
  dual-task costs. However, the effects of modality specific training programs have
  not been evaluated yet. Here, we tested the effects of cognitive-postural multi-tasking
  training on the ability to coordinate task mappings under high postural demands
  in healthy older adults. Twenty-one adults aged 65-85 years were assigned to one
  of two groups. While group 1 performed cognitive-postural triple-task training with
  compatible modality mappings (i.e., visual-manual and auditory-vocal dual n-back
  tasks), group 2 performed the same tasks with incompatible modality mappings (i.e.,
  visual-vocal and auditory-manual n-back tasks). Throughout the 6-weeks balance training
  intervention, working-memory load was gradually increased while base-of-support
  was reduced. Before training (T0), after a 6-week passive control period (T1), and
  immediately after the intervention (T2), participants performed spatial dual one-back
  tasks in semi-tandem stance position. Our results indicate improved working-memory
  performance and reduced dual-task costs for both groups after the passive control
  period, but no training-specific performance gains. Furthermore, balance performance
  did not improve in response to training. Notably, the cohort demonstrated meaningful
  interindividual variability in training responses. Our findings raise questions
  about practice effects and age-related heterogeneity of training responses following
  cognitive-motor training. Following multi-modal balance training, neither compatible
  nor incompatible modality mappings had an impact on the observed outcomes.
