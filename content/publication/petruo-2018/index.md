abstract: Demanding tasks like cognitive flexibility show time-related deterioration
  of performance (i.e. fatigability effects). Fatigability has been associated with
  structural and functional properties of the prefrontal cortex. However, the electrophysiological
  underpinnings of these processes are not well understood. We examined n,=,34 healthy
  participants with a task switching paradigm in which switches were either signaled
  by cues or needed to be maintained by working memory processes. We analyzed event-related
  potentials (ERPs) and performed residue iteration decomposition (RIDE) to account
  for effects of fatigue on intra-individual variability of neurophysiological data.
  This was combined with source localization methods. We show that task switching
  is affected by time on task (TOT) effects mostly when working memory processes are
  needed. On a neurophysiological level, this effect could not be observed in standard
  ERPs, but only after accounting for intra-individual variability using RIDE. The
  RIDE data suggests that during task switching, fatigability specifically affects
  response recoding processes that are associated with functions of the middle frontal
  gyrus (MFG; BA10). The results underline propositions of the 'opportunity cost model',
  which states that fatigability effects of executive functions depend on the degree
  to which tasks engage similar prefrontal regions - in this case working memory and
  task switching mechanisms.
