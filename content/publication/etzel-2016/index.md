abstract: Reward motivation often enhances task performance, but the neural mechanisms
  underlying such cognitive enhancement remain unclear. Here, we used a multivariate
  pattern analysis (MVPA) approach to test the hypothesis that motivation-related
  enhancement of cognitive control results from improved encoding and representation
  of task set information. Participants underwent two fMRI sessions of cued task switching,
  the first under baseline conditions, and the second with randomly intermixed reward
  incentive and no-incentive trials. Information about the upcoming task could be
  successfully decoded from cue-related activation patterns in a set of frontoparietal
  regions typically associated with task control. More critically, MVPA classifiers
  trained on the baseline session had significantly higher decoding accuracy on incentive
  than non-incentive trials, with decoding improvement mediating reward-related enhancement
  of behavioral performance. These results strongly support the hypothesis that reward
  motivation enhances cognitive control, by improving the discriminability of task-relevant
  information coded and maintained in frontoparietal brain regions.
