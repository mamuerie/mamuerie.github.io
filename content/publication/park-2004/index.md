abstract: The present study investigated whether neural structures become less functionally
  differentiated and specialized with age. We studied ventral visual cortex, an area
  of the brain that responds selectively to visual categories (faces, places, and
  words) in young adults, and that shows little atrophy with age. Functional MRI was
  used to estimate neural activity in this cortical area, while young and old adults
  viewed faces, houses, pseudowords, and chairs. The results demonstrated significantly
  less neural specialization for these stimulus categories in older adults across
  a range of analyses.
