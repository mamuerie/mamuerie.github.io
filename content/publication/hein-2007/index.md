abstract: Why is it hard to divide attention between dissimilar activities, such as
  reading and listening to a conversation? We used functional magnetic resonance imaging
  (fMRI) to study interference between simple auditory and visual decisions, independently
  of motor competition. Overlapping activity for auditory and visual tasks performed
  in isolation was found in lateral prefrontal regions, middle temporal cortex and
  parietal cortex. When the visual stimulus occurred during the processing of the
  tone, its activation in prefrontal and middle temporal cortex was suppressed. Additionally,
  reduced activity was seen in modality-specific visual cortex. These results paralleled
  impaired awareness of the visual event. Even without competing motor responses,
  a simple auditory decision interferes with visual processing on different neural
  levels, including prefrontal cortex, middle temporal cortex and visual regions.
