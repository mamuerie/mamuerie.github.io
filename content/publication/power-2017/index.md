abstract: Head motion can be estimated at any point of fMRI image processing. Processing
  steps involving temporal interpolation (e.g., slice time correction or outlier replacement)
  often precede motion estimation in the literature. From first principles it can
  be anticipated that temporal interpolation will alter head motion in a scan. Here
  we demonstrate this effect and its consequences in five large fMRI datasets. Estimated
  head motion was reduced by 10-50% or more following temporal interpolation, and
  reductions were often visible to the naked eye. Such reductions make the data seem
  to be of improved quality. Such reductions also degrade the sensitivity of analyses
  aimed at detecting motion-related artifact and can cause a dataset with artifact
  to falsely appear artifact-free. These reduced motion estimates will be particularly
  problematic for studies needing estimates of motion in time, such as studies of
  dynamics. Based on these findings, it is sensible to obtain motion estimates prior
  to any image processing (regardless of subsequent processing steps and the actual
  timing of motion correction procedures, which need not be changed). We also find
  that outlier replacement procedures change signals almost entirely during times
  of motion and therefore have notable similarities to motion-targeting censoring
  strategies (which withhold or replace signals entirely during times of motion).
