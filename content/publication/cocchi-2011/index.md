abstract: This study investigated the spatial, spectral, temporal and functional proprieties
  of functional brain connections involved in the concurrent execution of unrelated
  visual perception and working memory tasks. Electroencephalography data was analysed
  using a novel data-driven approach assessing source coherence at the whole-brain
  level. Three connections in the beta-band (18–24 Hz) and one in the gamma-band (30–40
  Hz) were modulated by dual-task performance. Beta-coherence increased within two
  dorsofrontal-occipital connections in dual-task conditions compared to the single-task
  condition, with the highest coherence seen during low working memory load trials.
  In contrast, beta-coherence in a prefrontal-occipital functional connection and
  gamma-coherence in an inferior frontal-occipitoparietal connection was not affected
  by the addition of the second task and only showed elevated coherence under high
  working memory load. Analysis of coherence as a function of time suggested that
  the dorsofrontal-occipital beta-connections were relevant to working memory maintenance,
  while the prefrontal-occipital beta-connection and the inferior frontal-occipitoparietal
  gamma-connection were involved in top-down control of concurrent visual processing.
  The fact that increased coherence in the gammaconnection, from low to high working
  memory load, was negatively correlated with faster reaction time on the perception
  task supports this interpretation. Together, these results demonstrate that dual-task
  demands trigger non-linear changes in functional interactions between frontal-executive
  and occipitoparietal-perceptual cortices.
