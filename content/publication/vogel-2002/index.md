abstract: After the detection of a target (T1) in a rapid stream of visual stimuli,
  there is a period of 400â€“ 600 msec during which a subsequent target (T2) is missed.
  This impairment in performance has been labeled the attentional blink. Recent theories
  propose that the attentional blink reflects a bottleneck in working memory consolidation
  such that T2 cannot be consolidated until after T1 is consolidated, and T2 is therefore
  masked by subsequent stimuli if it is presented while T1 is being consolidated.
  In support of this explanation, Giesbrecht & Di Lollo (1998) found that when T2
  is the final item in the stimulus stream, no attentional blink is observed, because
  there are no subsequent stimuli that might mask T2. To provide a direct test of
  this explanation of the attentional blink, in the present study we used the P3 component
  of the event-related potential waveform to track the processing of T2. When T2 was
  followed by a masking item, we found that the P3 wave was completely suppressed
  during the attentional blink period, indicating that T2 was not consolidated in
  working memory. When T2 was the last item in the stimulus stream, however, we found
  that the P3 wave was delayed but not suppressed, indicating that T2 consolidation
  was not eliminated but simply delayed. These results are consistent with a fundamental
  limit on the consolidation of information in working memory.
