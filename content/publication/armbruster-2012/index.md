abstract: The pFC is critical for cognitive flexibility (i.e., our ability to flexibly
  adjust behavior to changing environmental demands), but also for cognitive stability
  (i.e., our ability to follow behavioral plans in the face of distraction). Behavioral
  research suggests that individuals differ in their cognitive flexibility and stability,
  and neurocomputational theories of working memory relate this variability to the
  concept of attractor stability in recurrently connected neural networks. We introduce
  a novel task paradigm to simultaneously assess flexible switching between task rules
  (cognitive flexibility) and task performance in the presence of irrelevant distractors
  (cognitive stability) and to furthermore assess the individual \"spontaneous switching
  rate\" in response to ambiguous stimuli to quantify the individual dispositional
  cognitive flexibility in a theoretically motivated way (i.e., as a proxy for attractor
  stability). Using fMRI in healthy human participants, a common network consisting
  of parietal and frontal areas was found for task switching and distractor inhibition.
  More flexible persons showed reduced activation and reduced functional coupling
  in frontal areas, including the inferior frontal junction, during task switching.
  Most importantly, the individual spontaneous switching rate antagonistically affected
  the functional coupling between inferior frontal junction and the superior frontal
  gyrus during task switching and distractor inhibition, respectively, indicating
  that individual differences in cognitive flexibility and stability are indeed related
  to a common prefrontal neural mechanism. We suggest that the concept of attractor
  stability of prefrontal working memory networks is a meaningful model for individual
  differences in cognitive stability versus flexibility.
