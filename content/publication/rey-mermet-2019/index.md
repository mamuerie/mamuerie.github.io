abstract: 'In the last two decades, individual-differences research has put forward
  3 cognitive psychometric constructs: executive control (i.e., the ability to monitor
  and control ongoing thoughts and actions), working memory capacity (WMC, i.e., the
  ability to retain access to a limited amount of information in the service of complex
  tasks), and fluid intelligence (gF, i.e., the ability to reason with novel information).
  These constructs have been proposed to be closely related, but previous research
  failed to substantiate a strong correlation between executive control and the other
  two constructs. This might arise from the difficulty in establishing executive control
  as a latent variable and from differences in the way the 3 constructs are measured
  (i.e., executive control is typically measured through reaction times, whereas WMC
  and gF are measured through accuracy). The purpose of the present study was to overcome
  these difficulties by measuring executive control through accuracy. Despite good
  reliabilities of all measures, structural equation modeling identified no coherent
  factor of executive control. Furthermore, WMC and gF-modeled as distinct but correlated
  factors-were unrelated to the individual measures of executive control. Hence, measuring
  executive control through accuracy did not overcome the difficulties of establishing
  executive control as a latent variable. These findings call into question the existence
  of executive control as a psychometric construct and the assumption that WMC and
  gF are closely related to the ability to control ongoing thoughts and actions. (PsycINFO
