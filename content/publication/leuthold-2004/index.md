abstract: The execution of efficient motor actions is often preceded by preparation
  in the central nervous system. Although this kind of preparation cannot be observed
  directly, it, nevertheless, shortens reaction time. In this review we focus on two
  types of action preparation, namely event and temporal preparation. In particular,
  we show how modern event-related brain potential techniques can be employed to determine
  both the covert processes underlying such preparatory effects as well as their locus
  within the processing chain between stimulus input and action output.
