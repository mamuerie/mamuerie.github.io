 abstract = {The execution of efficient motor actions is often preceded by preparation in the central nervous system. Although this kind of preparation cannot be observed directly, it, nevertheless, shortens reaction time. In this review we focus on two types of action preparation, namely event and temporal preparation. In particular, we show how modern event-related brain potential techniques can be employed to determine both the covert processes underlying such preparatory effects as well as their locus within the processing chain between stimulus input and action output.},
