abstract: Visual attention enables observers to extract and process high-priority
  information in the visualfield. Controversy remains as to whether or not observers
  can ignore information that falls within the spatial beam of attention. We used
  an objective physiological measure, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP),
  to investigate this question. A stream of flickering small, uppercase letters was
  embedded in the center of a stream of large, uppercase letters. A unitary beam would
  result in no difference of the SSVEP amplitude elicited by the small letter stream
  when it was attended versus ignored (i.e., when subjects attended the large letter
  stream). Contrary to this prediction, SSVEP amplitude increased by almost 100% when
  the small letter stream was attended compared with when it was ignored. The results
  support the notion that the attentional spotlight can be formed like a doughnut,
  processing central information differentially depending on whether it is attended
  or ignored.
