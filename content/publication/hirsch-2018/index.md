abstract: In the present study, participants performed highly comparable task-switching
  and dual-task paradigms, and the paradigm-specific performance costs were analysed
  in the context of the commonly postulated core components of cognitive control (i.e.,
  working memory updating, inhibition, and shifting). In the task-switching paradigm,
  we found switch costs (i.e., switch trials vs. repetition trials) and mixing costs
  (i.e., repetition trials in mixed-task blocks vs. single-task trials). In the dual-task
  paradigm, we observed a psychological refractory period (PRP) effect (i.e., Task
  2 [T2] performance after short stimulus-onset asynchrony [SOA] vs. long SOA), dual-task
  costs (i.e., T2 dual-task performance with a long SOA in trials with a task repetition
  between Task 1 [T1] and T2 vs. single-task performance), and switch costs in T2
  (i.e., dual-task performance in trials with a switch between T1 and T2 vs. dual-task
  performance in trials with a repetition between T1 and T2). A within-subjects comparison
  of the performance costs showed a correlation between mixing costs and dual-task
  costs, possibly indicating shared underlying cognitive control processes in terms
  of working memory updating. Surprisingly, there was also a correlation between switch
  costs and the PRP effect, presumably suggesting that cognitive control, as opposed
  to passive queuing of response selection processes, contributes to the PRP effect.
