abstract: Functional coupling across distributed brain regions varies across task
  contexts, yet there are stable features. To better understand the range and central
  tendencies of network configurations, coupling patterns were explored using functional
  MRI (fMRI) across 14 distinct continuously performed task states ranging from passive
  fixation to increasingly demanding classification tasks. Mean global correlation
  profiles across the cortex ranged from 0.69 to 0.82 between task states. Network
  configurations from both passive fixation and classification tasks similarly predicted
  task coactivation patterns estimated from meta-analysis of the literature. Thus,
  even across markedly different task states, central tendencies dominate the coupling
  configurations. Beyond these shared components, distinct task states displayed significant
  differences in coupling patterns in response to their varied demands. One possibility
  is that anatomical connectivity provides constraints that act as attractors pulling
  network configurations towards a limited number of robust states. Reconfigurable
  coupling modes emerge as significant modifications to a core functional architecture.
