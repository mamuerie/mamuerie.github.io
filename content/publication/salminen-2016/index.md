abstract: Age-related decline in executive functions can be decisive in performing
  everyday tasks autonomously. Working memory (WM) is closely related to executive
  functions, and training of WM has yielded evidence toward cognitive plasticity in
  older adults. The training effects often transfer to untrained tasks and functions.
  These effects have mostly been shown in processes such as WM and attention, whereas
  studies investigating transfer to executive functions have been scarce. We trained
  older adults aged 57-73 years in a WM training task that was reported to be effective
  in producing transfer in young adults. The training intervention consisted of a
  dual n-back task including independently processed auditory and visual n-back tasks.
  We investigated transfer to tasks engaging executive functions, and compared the
  effects in older adults to those reported in young adults. We found that both training
  groups improved in the training task. Although the training effect in older adults
  was smaller than the training effect in young adults, the older adults still showed
  a notable improvement so that after training they performed on the same level as
  young adults without training. The older adults also showed transfer to an untrained
  WM updating task, a result that was in accordance with the findings in young adults;
  other transfer effects in older adults were lacking. We conclude that although transfer
  effects were scarce, the present study provides encouraging evidence toward the
  possibilities to compensate for age-related decline in executive functions by a
  WM training intervention.
