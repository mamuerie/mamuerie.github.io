abstract: Learning novel skills involves reorganization and optimization of cognitive
  processing involving a broad network of brain regions. Previous work has shown asymmetric
  costs of switching to a well-trained task vs. a poorly-trained task, but the neural
  basis of these differential switch costs is unclear. The current study examined
  the neural signature of task switching in the context of acquisition of new skill.
  Human participants alternated randomly between a novel visual task (mirror-reversed
  word reading) and a highly practiced one (plain word reading), allowing the isolation
  of task switching and skill set maintenance. Two scan sessions were separated by
  2 weeks, with behavioral training on the mirror reading task in between the two
  sessions. Broad cortical regions, including bilateral prefrontal, parietal, and
  extrastriate cortices, showed decreased activity associated with learning of the
  mirror reading skill. In contrast, learning to switch to the novel skill was associated
  with decreased activity in a focal subcortical region in the dorsal striatum. Switching
  to the highly practiced task was associated with a non-overlapping set of regions,
  suggesting substantial differences in the neural substrates of switching as a function
  of task skill. Searchlight multivariate pattern analysis also revealed that learning
  was associated with decreased pattern information for mirror vs. plain reading tasks
  in fronto-parietal regions. Inferior frontal junction and posterior parietal cortex
  showed a joint effect of univariate activation and pattern information. These results
  suggest distinct learning mechanisms task performance and executive control as a
  function of learning.
