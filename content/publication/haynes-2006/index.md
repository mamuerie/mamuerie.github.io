abstract: Recent advances in human neuroimaging have shown that it is possible to
  accurately decode a person's conscious experience based only on non-invasive measurements
  of their brain activity. Such 'brain reading' has mostly been studied in the domain
  of visual perception, where it helps reveal the way in which individual experiences
  are encoded in the human brain. The same approach can also be extended to other
  types of mental state, such as covert attitudes and lie detection. Such applications
  raise important ethical issues concerning the privacy of personal thought.
