abstract: The relations between dual-task effects and aging were examined through
  a meta-analysis of 33 studies (with 48 independent participant groups) using latency
  as the dependent measure and 30 studies (with 40 independent participant groups)
  focusing on accuracy. Brinley plots and state traces were derived, and a model to
  explicate different types of complexity (additive and multiplicative) was developed.
  The effects of dual-task processing on latency were additive, and this additive
  cost was larger in older adults than in younger adults and larger than predicted
  from general slowing. This cost was small and independent of task complexity. The
  effects of dual-task processing on logit-transformed accuracy were likewise additive,
  but no specific age deficit was associated with this dual-task cost.
