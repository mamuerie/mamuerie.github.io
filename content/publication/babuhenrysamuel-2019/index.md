abstract: Prolonged performance of a demanding cognitive task induces cognitive fatigue.
  We examined the behavioral and neural responses to fatigue-induced cognitive impairments
  in young and older adults. Particular emphasis was placed on whether the brain exhibited
  compensatory neural activity in response to cognitive fatigue. High-density EEG
  was recorded from a young (n = 16; 18-33 years of age) and an older (n = 18; 60-87
  years of age) cohort who performed a Stroop task continuously for âˆ¼2 h with no breaks.
  In the young cohort, behavioral performance declined as the experiment progressed,
  reflecting the deleterious effects of cognitive fatigue. Neurophysiologically, in
  addition to declining neural activity as cognitive fatigue developed, there is also
  evidence of region- and time-specific increase in neural activity, suggesting neural
  compensation. The compensatory activities followed patterns paralleling that of
  posterior-anterior shift in aging (PASA) and early to late shift in aging (ELSA)
  observed in cognitive aging and helped to moderate fatigue-induced behavioral deterioration.
  In the older cohort, behavioral performance did not decline as the experiment progressed,
  and neural activity either declined or stayed unchanged, showing no evidence of
  neural compensation, in contrast to the young. These results suggest that young
  and older adults coped with cognitive fatigue differently by exhibiting differential
  responses as a function of time-on-task at both the behavioral level and the neural
  level.
