abstract: Intelligence-related differences in the intrinsic functional organization
  of the brain were studied with a graphtheoretical approach, comparing effects on
  nodal measures of brain network efficiency (concerning specific nodes of the network)
  and global measures (concerning the overall brain network). Functional imaging data
  acquired for 54 healthy adult participants during wakeful rest were modeled as graphs
  representing individual functional brain networks. Nodal and global measures of
  efficient network organization (i.e., nodal efficiency and global efficiency) were
  correlated with intelligence scores (IQ from the Wechsler Abbreviate Scale of Intelligence,
  WASI). While global efficiency showed no significant association with intelligence,
  the nodal efficiency was significantly associated with intelligence in three brain
  regions. Participants with higher IQ scores showed higher nodal efficiency in right
  anterior insula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), two hub regions
  of a functional brain network previously described as salience network. Furthermore,
  higher IQ was associated with lower nodal efficiency in the left temporo-parietal
  junction area (TPJ). Distinct connectivity profiles were observed for brain regions
  showing a positive versus negative correlation between IQ and nodal efficiency.
  Our analyses suggest that intrinsic (i.e., task-independent) connectivity profiles
  of brain regions that have previously been associated with salience processing (AI
  and dACC) and the filtering of irrelevant information from higher-level processing
  (TPJ), play a role in explaining individual differences in intelligence. Based on
  these intelligence-related effects in resting-state fMRI data, we discuss the potential
  relevance of processing salient information for the explanation of differences in
  cognitive performance and intelligence.
