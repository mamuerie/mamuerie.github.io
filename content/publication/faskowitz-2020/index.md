abstract: Network neuroscience has relied on a node-centric network model in which
  cells, populations and regions are linked to one another via anatomical or functional
  connections. This model cannot account for interactions of edges with one another.
  In this study, we developed an edge-centric network model that generates constructs
  'edge time series' and 'edge functional connectivity' (eFC). Using network analysis,
  we show that, at rest, eFC is consistent across datasets and reproducible within
  the same individual over multiple scan sessions. We demonstrate that clustering
  eFC yields communities of edges that naturally divide the brain into overlapping
  clusters, with regions in sensorimotor and attentional networks exhibiting the greatest
  levels of overlap. We show that eFC is systematically modulated by variation in
  sensory input. In future work, the edge-centric approach could be useful for identifying
  novel biomarkers of disease, characterizing individual variation and mapping the
  architecture of highly resolved neural circuits.
