abstract: Head motion systematically distorts clinical and research MRI data. Motion
  artifacts have biased findings from many structural and functional brain MRI studies.
  An effective way to remove motion artifacts is to exclude MRI data frames affected
  by head motion. However, such post-hoc frame censoring can lead to data loss rates
  of 50% or more in our pediatric patient cohorts. Hence, many scanner operators collect
  additional 'buffer data', an expensive practice that, by itself, does not guarantee
  sufficient high-quality MRI data for a given participant. Therefore, we developed
  an easy-to-setup, easy-to-use Framewise Integrated Real-time MRI Monitoring (FIRMM)
  software suite that provides scanner operators with head motion analytics in real-time,
  allowing them to scan each subject until the desired amount of low-movement data
  has been collected. Our analyses show that using FIRMM to identify the ideal scan
  time for each person can reduce total brain MRI scan times and associated costs
  by 50% or more.
