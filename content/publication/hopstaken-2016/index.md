abstract: There is an increasing amount of evidence that during mental fatigue, shifts
  in motivation drive performance rather than reductions in finite mental energy.
  So far, studies that investigated such an approach have mainly focused on cognitive
  indicators of task engagement that were measured during controlled tasks, offering
  limited to no alternative stimuli. Therefore it remained unclear whether during
  fatigue, attention is diverted to stimuli that are unrelated to the task, or whether
  fatigued individuals still focused on the task but were unable to use their cognitive
  resources efficiently. With a combination of subjective, EEG, pupil, eye-tracking,
  and performance measures the present study investigated the influence of mental
  fatigue on a cognitive task which also contained alternative task-unrelated stimuli.
  With increasing time-on-task, task engagement and performance decreased, but there
  was no significant decrease in gaze toward the task-related stimuli. After increasing
  the task rewards, irrelevant rewarding stimuli where largely ignored, and task engagement
  and performance were restored, even though participants still reported to be highly
  fatigued. Overall, these findings support an explanation of less efficient processing
  of the task that is influenced by motivational cost/reward tradeoffs, rather than
  a depletion of a finite mental energy resource. (PsycINFO Database Record
