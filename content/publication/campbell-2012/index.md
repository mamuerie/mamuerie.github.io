abstract: Current evidence suggests that older adults have reduced suppression of,
  and greater implicit memory for, distracting stimuli, due to age-related declines
  in frontal-based control mechanisms. In this study, we used fMRI to examine age
  differences in the neural underpinnings of attentional control and their relationship
  to differences in distractibility and subsequent memory for distraction. Older and
  younger adults were shown a rapid stream of words or nonwords superimposed on objects
  and performed a 1-back task on either the letters or the objects, while ignoring
  the other modality. Older adults were more distracted than younger adults by the
  overlapping words during the 1-back task, and they subsequently showed more priming
  for these words on an implicit memory task. A multivariate analysis of the imaging
  data revealed a set of regions, including the rostral PFC and inferior parietal
  cortex, that younger adults activated to a greater extent than older adults during
  the ignore-words condition, and activity in this set of regions was negatively correlated
  with priming for the distracting words. Functional connectivity analyses using right
  and left rostral PFC seeds revealed a network of putative control regions, including
  bilateral parietal cortex, connected to the frontal seeds at rest. Older adults
  showed reduced functional connectivity within this frontoparietal network, suggesting
  that their greater distractibility may be due to decreased activity and coherence
  within a cognitive control network that normally acts to reduce interference from
  distraction.
