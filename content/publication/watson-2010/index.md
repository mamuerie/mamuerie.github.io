abstract: Theory suggests that driving should be impaired for any motorist who is
  concurrently talking on a cell phone. But is everybody impaired by this dual-task
  combination? We tested 200 participants in a high-fidelity driving simulator in
  both single- and dual-task conditions. The dual task involved driving while performing
  a demanding auditory version of the operation span (OSPAN) task. Whereas the vast
  majority of participants showed significant performance decrements in dual-task
  conditions (compared with single-task conditions for either driving or OSPAN tasks),
  2.5% of the sample showed absolutely no performance decrements with respect to performing
  single and dual tasks. In single-task conditions, these “supertaskers” scored in
  the top quartile on all dependent measures associated with driving and OSPAN tasks,
  and Monte Carlo simulations indicated that the frequency of supertaskers was significantly
  greater than chance. These individual differences help to sharpen our theoretical
  understanding of attention and cognitive control in naturalistic settings.
