abstract: We provide an \"executive-attention\" framework for organizing the cognitive
  neuroscience research on the constructs of working-memory capacity (WMC), general
  fluid intelligence, and prefrontal cortex (PFC) function. Rather than provide a
  novel theory of PFC function, we synthesize a wealth of single-cell, brain-imaging,
  and neuropsychological research through the lens of our theory of normal individual
  differences in WMC and attention control (Engle, Kane, & Tuholski, 1999; Engle,
  Tuholski, Laughlin, & Conway, 1999). Our critical review confirms the prevalent
  view that dorsolateral PFC circuitry is critical to executive-attention functions.
  Moreover, although the dorsolateral PFC is but one critical structure in a network
  of anterior and posterior \"attention control\" areas, it does have a unique executive-attention
  role in actively maintaining access to stimulus representations and goals in interference-rich
  contexts. Our review suggests the utility of an executive-attention framework for
  guiding future research on both PFC function and cognitive control.
