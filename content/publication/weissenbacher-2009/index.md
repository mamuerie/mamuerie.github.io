abstract: Resting-state data sets contain coherent fluctuations unrelated to neural
  processes originating from residual motion artefacts, respiration and cardiac action.
  Such confounding effects may introduce correlations and cause an overestimation
  of functional connectivity strengths. In this study we applied several multidimensional
  linear regression approaches to remove artificial coherencies and examined the impact
  of preprocessing on sensitivity and specificity of functional connectivity results
  in simulated data and resting-state data sets from 40 subjects. Furthermore, we
  aimed at clarifying possible causes of anticorrelations and test the hypothesis
  that anticorrelations are introduced via certain preprocessing approaches, with
  particular focus on the effects of regression against the global signal. Our results
  show that preprocessing in general greatly increased connection specificity, in
  particular correction for global signal fluctuations almost doubled connection specificity.
  However, widespread anticorrelated networks were only found when regression against
  the global signal was applied. Results in simulated data sets compared with result
  of human data strongly suggest that anticorrelations are indeed introduced by global
  signal regression and should therefore be interpreted very carefully. In addition,
  global signal regression may also reduce the sensitivity for detecting true correlations,
  i.e. increase the number of false negatives. Concluding from our results we suggest
  that is highly recommended to apply correction against realignment parameters, white
  matter and ventricular time courses, as well as the global signal to maximize the
  specificity of positive resting-state correlations.
