abstract: The present study examined the relationship between personality and individual
  differences in multi-tasking ability. Participants enrolled at the University of
  Utah completed measures of multi-tasking activity, perceived multi-tasking ability,
  impulsivity, and sensation seeking. In addition, they performed the Operation Span
  in order to assess their executive control and actual multi-tasking ability. The
  findings indicate that the persons who are most capable of multi-tasking effectively
  are not the persons who are most likely to engage in multiple tasks simultaneously.
  To the contrary, multi-tasking activity as measured by the Media Multitasking Inventory
  and self-reported cell phone usage while driving were negatively correlated with
  actual multi-tasking ability. Multi-tasking was positively correlated with participants’
  perceived ability to multi-task ability which was found to be significantly inflated.
  Participants with a strong approach orientation and a weak avoidance orientation
  – high levels of impulsivity and sensation seeking – reported greater multi-tasking
  behavior. Finally, the findings suggest that people often engage in multi-tasking
  because they are less able to block out distractions and focus on a singular task.
  Participants with less executive control - low scorers on the Operation Span task
  and persons high in impulsivity - tended to report higher levels of multi-tasking
  activity.
