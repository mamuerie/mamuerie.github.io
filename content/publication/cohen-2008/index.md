abstract: The cerebral cortex is anatomically organized at many physical scales starting
  at the level of single neurons and extending up to functional systems. Current functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies often focus at the level of areas, networks,
  and systems. Except in restricted domains, (e.g., topographically-organized sensory
  regions), it is difficult to determine area boundaries in the human brain using
  fMRI. The ability to delineate functional areas non-invasively would enhance the
  quality of many experimental analyses allowing more accurate across-subject comparisons
  of independently identified functional areas. Correlations in spontaneous BOLD activity,
  often referred to as resting state functional connectivity (rs-fcMRI), are especially
  promising as a way to accurately localize differences in patterns of activity across
  large expanses of cortex. In the current report, we applied a novel set of image
  analysis tools to explore the utility of rs-fcMRI for defining wide-ranging functional
  area boundaries. We find that rs-fcMRI patterns show sharp transitions in correlation
  patterns and that these putative areal boundaries can be reliably detected in individual
  subjects as well as in group data. Additionally, combining surface-based analysis
  techniques with image processing algorithms allows automated mapping of putative
  areal boundaries across large expanses of cortex without the need for prior information
  about a region's function or topography. Our approach reliably produces maps of
  bounded regions appropriate in size and number for putative functional areas. These
  findings will hopefully stimulate further methodological refinements and validations.
