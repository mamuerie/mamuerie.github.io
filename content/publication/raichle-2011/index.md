abstract: The pressing need to better understand human brain organization is appreciated
  by all who have labored to explain the uniqueness of human behavior in health and
  disease. Early work on the cytoarchitectonics of the human brain by Brodmann and
  others accompanied by several centuries of lesion behavior work, although valuable,
  has left us far short of what we need. Fortunately, modern brain imaging techniques
  have, over the past 40 years, substantially changed the situation by permitting
  the safe appraisal of both anatomical and functional relationships within the living
  human brain. An unexpected feature of this work is the critical importance of ongoing,
  intrinsic activity, which accounts for the majority of brain's energy consumption
  and exhibits a surprising level of organization that emerges with dimensions of
  both space and time. In this essay, some of the unique features of intrinsic activity
  are reviewed, as it relates to our understanding of brain organization.
