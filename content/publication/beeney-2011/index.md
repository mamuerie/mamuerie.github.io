abstract: "Empathy is generally thought of as the ability to share the emotional experiences
  of others. In scientific terms, this is usually operationalized as an ability to
  vicariously feel others' mental and emotional experiences. Supporting this account,
  research demonstrates that watching others experience physical pain activates similar
  brain regions to the actual experience of pain itself. First-hand experience of
  social rejection also activates this network. The current work extends these findings
  by examining whether the \\\"pain\\\" network is similarly implicated in witnessing
  rejection, and whether emotional closeness modulates this response. We provide evidence
  for each of these suppositions, demonstrating: (a) that the pain network is activated
  when watching a friend suffer social rejection, and (b) that interpersonal closeness
  with that friend modulates this response. Further, we found that the inferior frontal
  gyrus, critical for representing others' mental and emotional states, mediates the
  relationship between emotional closeness and neural responses to watching the rejection
  of a friend."
