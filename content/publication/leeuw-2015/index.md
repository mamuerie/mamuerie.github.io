abstract: Online experiments are growing in popularity, and the increasing sophistication
  of Web technology has made it possible to run complex behavioral experiments online
  using only a Web browser. Unlike with offline laboratory experiments, however, few
  tools exist to aid in the development of browser-based experiments. This makes the
  process of creating an experiment slow and challenging, particularly for researchers
  who lack a Web development background. This article introduces jsPsych, a JavaScript
  library for the development of Web-based experiments. jsPsych formalizes a way of
  describing experiments that is much simpler than writing the entire experiment from
  scratch. jsPsych then executes these descriptions automatically, handling the flow
  from one task to another. The jsPsych library is open-source and designed to be
  expanded by the research community. The project is available online at www.jspsych.org
