abstract: Control by action representation and input selection (CARIS) is a modeling
  framework for task-switching experiments, which considers action-related effects
  as critical constraints. It assumes that control operates by choosing control parameter
  values, representing input selection and action representation. Competing CARIS
  models differ in whether (a) control parameters are determined by current instructions
  or represent a perseveration, (b) current instructions apply to the input selection
  and/or to action representation. According to the chosen model (a) task execution
  results in a default bias in favor of the executed task thus creating perseverative
  tendencies; (b) control counteracts these tendencies by applying a transient momentary
  bias whose locus (input selection or action representation) changes as a function
  of task preparation time; (c) this happens because the task-cue (e.g., SHAPE) initially
  attracts attention to the immediately available cue-information (e.g., target shape)
  and then attracts it to inferred or retrieved information (e.g., \"circle\" is related
  to the right key press).
