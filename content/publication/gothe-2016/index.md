abstract: 'We tested the independent influences of two content-based factors on dual-task
  costs, and on the parallel processing ability: The pairing of S-R modalities and
  the pairing of relevant features between stimuli and responses of two tasks. The
  two pairing factors were realized across four dual-task groups. Within each group
  the two tasks comprised two different stimulus modalities (visual and auditory),
  two different relevant stimulus features (spatial and verbal) and two response modalities
  (manual and vocal). Pairings of S-R modalities (standard: visual-manual and auditory-vocal,
  non-standard: visual-vocal and auditory-manual) and feature pairings (standard:
  spatial-manual and verbal-vocal, non-standard: spatial-vocal and verbal-manual)
  varied across groups. All participants practiced their respective dual-task combination
  in a paradigm with simultaneous stimulus onset before being transferred to a psychological
  refractory period paradigm varying stimulus-onset asynchrony. A comparison at the
  end of practice revealed similar dual-task costs and similar pairing effects in
  both paradigms. Dual-task costs depended on modality and feature pairings. Groups
  training with non-standard feature pairings (i.e., verbal stimulus features mapped
  to spatially separated response keys, or spatial stimulus features mapped to verbal
  responses) and non-standard modality pairings (i.e., auditory stimulus mapped to
  manual response, or visual stimulus mapped to vocal responses) had higher dual-task
  costs than respective standard pairings. In contrast, irrespective of modality pairing
  dual-task costs virtually disappeared with standard feature pairings after practice
  in both paradigms. The results can be explained by crosstalk between feature-binding
  processes for the two tasks. Crosstalk was present for non-standard but absent for
  standard feature pairings. Therefore, standard feature pairings enabled parallel
  processing at the end of practice.'
