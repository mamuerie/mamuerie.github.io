abstract: Since initial reports regarding the impact of motion artifact on measures
  of functional connectivity, there has been a proliferation of participant-level
  confound regression methods to limit its impact. However, many of the most commonly
  used techniques have not been systematically evaluated using a broad range of outcome
  measures. Here, we provide a systematic evaluation of 14 participant-level confound
  regression methods in 393 youths. Specifically, we compare methods according to
  four benchmarks, including the residual relationship between motion and connectivity,
  distance-dependent effects of motion on connectivity, network identifiability, and
  additional degrees of freedom lost in confound regression. Our results delineate
  two clear trade-offs among methods. First, methods that include global signal regression
  minimize the relationship between connectivity and motion, but result in distance-dependent
  artifact. In contrast, censoring methods mitigate both motion artifact and distance-dependence,
  but use additional degrees of freedom. Importantly, less effective de-noising methods
  are also unable to identify modular network structure in the connectome. Taken together,
  these results emphasize the heterogeneous efficacy of existing methods, and suggest
  that different confound regression strategies may be appropriate in the context
  of specific scientific goals.
