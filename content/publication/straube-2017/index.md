abstract: Predictive mechanisms are essential to successfully interact with the environment
  and to compensate for delays in the transmission of neural signals. However, whether
  and how we predict multisensory action outcomes remains largely unknown. Here we
  investigated the existence of multisensory predictive mechanisms in a context where
  actions have outcomes in different modalities. During fMRI data acquisition auditory,
  visual and auditory-visual stimuli were presented in active and passive conditions.
  In the active condition, a self-initiated button press elicited the stimuli with
  variable short delays (0-417ms) between action and outcome, and participants had
  to detect the presence of a delay for auditory or visual outcome (task modality).
  In the passive condition, stimuli appeared automatically, and participants had to
  detect the number of stimulus modalities (unimodal/bimodal). For action consequences
  compared to identical but unpredictable control stimuli we observed suppression
  of the blood oxygen level depended (BOLD) response in a broad network including
  bilateral auditory and visual cortices. This effect was independent of task modality
  or stimulus modality and strongest for trials where no delay was detected (undetected
