abstract: Our performance on a task decreases when the task is in a dual-task situation
  than when it is in isolation. An important experimental setting for dual-task situation
  is the psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm, and the dual-task performance
  decrements in the PRP paradigm are referred to as PRP interference. The standard
  response-selection bottleneck (RSB) models state that the response-selection stage
  of the second task (T2) cannot start until the response-selection stage of the first
  task (T1) finishes, resulting in the PRP interference. Contrary to the prediction
  of RSB models, several researchers have found T2's modulations on T1's performance,
  and have suggested that T1's selection-related processes are affected by T2's selection-related
  processes, referred to as backward crosstalk effects. The locus of backward crosstalk
  effects is not clear, however, because RTs were measured in most previous studies.
  By using semantically unrelated stimuli and responses and by measuring T1's lateralized
  readiness potential, we examined the locus of backward crosstalk effects. We found
  that the interval between T1's stimulus onset and the stimulus-locked LRP onset
  was affected, suggesting T2's response selection starts before T1's selection is
  complete. The present result provided electrophysiological evidence focusing on
  T1's changes in favor of the hypothesis of parallel response selection in the PRP
  paradigm.
