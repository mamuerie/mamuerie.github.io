abstract: The purpose of this paper was to provide insight into the nature of response
  selection by reviewing the literature on stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) effects
  and the psychological refractory period (PRP) effect individually and jointly. The
  empirical findings and theoretical explanations of SRC effects that have been studied
  within a single-task context suggest that there are two response-selection routes-automatic
  activation and intentional translation. In contrast, all major PRP models reviewed
  in this paper have treated response selection as a single processing stage. In particular,
  the response-selection bottleneck (RSB) model assumes that the processing of Task
  1 and Task 2 comprises two separate streams and that the PRP effect is due to a
  bottleneck located at response selection. Yet, considerable evidence from studies
  of SRC in the PRP paradigm shows that the processing of the two tasks is more interactive
  than is suggested by the RSB model and by most other models of the PRP effect. The
  major implication drawn from the studies of SRC effects in the PRP context is that
  response activation is a distinct process from final response selection. Response
  activation is based on both long-term and short-term task-defined S-R associations
  and occurs automatically and in parallel for the two tasks. The final response selection
  is an intentional act required even for highly compatible and practiced tasks and
  is restricted to processing one task at a time. Investigations of SRC effects and
  response-selection variables in dual-task contexts should be conducted more systematically
  because they provide significant insight into the nature of response-selection mechanisms.
