abstract: Previous studies have provided evidence that introspection about dual-task
  performance in the psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm is severely limited.
  The present study investigated introspection at the other pole of the multitasking
  continuum, namely task switching. In 2 experiments, participants provided estimates
  of their response times (i.e., introspective RTs) after each trial in modified versions
  of the alternating-runs and the task-cuing paradigm, which included only 2 tasks
  in a trial. In contrast to the previously observed unawareness of dual-task costs
  in the PRP paradigm, participants reported their switch costs in introspective RTs.
  Thus, introspection about multitasking performance appears to not always be as limited
  as in the PRP paradigm. Nevertheless, introspection is not without limits also in
  task switching. Participants only partly reported the beneficial impact of longer
  preparation time on their performance. The present results suggest that introspective
  RTs depend on multiple cues, of which some are valid and some are invalid. (PsycINFO
