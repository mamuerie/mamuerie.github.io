abstract: BACKGROUND  Mental fatigue (MF) is a psychobiological state that impairs
  endurance performance in healthy athletes. Recently, multiple studies indicated
  that MF could also impair sport-specific psychomotor performance (SSPP). Nevertheless,
  a systematic overview detailing the effects of MF on SSPP is currently lacking.  OBJECTIVE  The
  objective of this study is to collate relevant literature and examine the effect
  of MF on SSPP. A secondary aim was to create an overview of the potential subjective
  and physiological factors underlying this MF effect.  METHODS  PubMed (MEDLINE),
  Web of Science, PsycINFO and SPORTDiscus were searched (5th of November 2020). Studies
  were eligible when study outcomes encompassed any form of SSPP skill in a sport-specific
  context, the intervention was targeted to induce MF, and the population included
  healthy individuals. The presence of a manipulation check, to indicate the successful
  induction of MF, was obligatory for inclusion. Secondary outcomes were all outcomes
  (either physiological or psychological) that could explain the underlying mechanisms
  of the effect of MF on SSPP.  RESULTS  In total, 21 papers were included. MF was
  successfully induced in all but two studies, which were excluded from further analysis.
  MF negatively impacts a myriad of SSPP outcomes, including decision-making, reaction
  time and accuracy outcomes. No changes in physiological outcomes, that could underlie
  the effect of MF, were reported. Subjectively, only ratings of perceived of exertion
  increased due to MF in some studies.  CONCLUSIONS  Overall, the selected papers
  indicated that MF negatively affects SSPP. Research that assesses brain function,
  while evaluating the effect of MF on SSPP is essential to create further insight.
