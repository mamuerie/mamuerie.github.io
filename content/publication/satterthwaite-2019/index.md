abstract: Motion artifacts are now recognized as a major methodological challenge
  for studies of functional connectivity. As in-scanner motion is frequently correlated
  with variables of interest such as age, clinical status, cognitive ability, and
  symptom severity, in-scanner motion has the potential to introduce systematic bias.
  In this article, we describe how motion-related artifacts influence measures of
  functional connectivity and discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of commonly
  used denoising strategies. Furthermore, we illustrate how motion can bias inference,
  using a study of brain development as an example. Finally, we highlight directions
  of ongoing and future research, and provide recommendations for investigators in
  the field. Hum Brain Mapp, 40:2033-2051, 2019. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
