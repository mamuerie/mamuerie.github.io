abstract: 'How do people automatize their dual-task performance through bottleneck
  bypassing (i.e., accomplish parallel processing of the central stages of two tasks)?
  In the present work we addressed this question, evaluating the impact of sensory-motor
  modality compatibility-the similarity in modality between the stimulus and the consequences
  of the response. We hypothesized that incompatible sensory-motor modalities (e.g.,
  visual-vocal) create conflicts within modality-specific working memory subsystems,
  and therefore predicted that tasks producing such conflicts would be performed less
  automatically after practice. To probe for automaticity, we used a transfer psychological
  refractory period (PRP) procedure: Participants were first trained on a visual task
  (Exp. 1) or an auditory task (Exp. 2) by itself, which was later presented as Task
  2, along with an unpracticed Task 1. The Task 1-Task 2 sensory-motor modality pairings
  were either compatible (visual-manual and auditory-vocal) or incompatible (visual-vocal
  and auditory-manual). In both experiments we found converging indicators of bottleneck
  bypassing (small dual-task interference and a high rate of response reversals) for
  compatible sensory-motor modalities, but indicators of bottlenecking (large dual-task
  interference and few response reversals) for incompatible sensory-motor modalities.
  Relatedly, the proportion of individuals able to bypass the bottleneck was high
  for compatible modalities but very low for incompatible modalities. We propose that
  dual-task automatization is within reach when the tasks rely on codes that do not
  compete within a working memory subsystem.'
