abstract: Early career researchers (ECRs) are important stakeholders leading efforts
  to catalyze systemic change in research culture and practice. Here, we summarize
  the outputs from a virtual unconventional conference (unconference), which brought
  together 54 invited experts from 20 countries with extensive experience in ECR initiatives
  designed to improve the culture and practice of science. Together, we drafted 2
  sets of recommendations for (1) ECRs directly involved in initiatives or activities
  to change research culture and practice; and (2) stakeholders who wish to support
  ECRs in these efforts. Importantly, these points apply to ECRs working to promote
  change on a systemic level, not only those improving aspects of their own work.
  In both sets of recommendations, we underline the importance of incentivizing and
  providing time and resources for systems-level science improvement activities, including
  ECRs in organizational decision-making processes, and working to dismantle structural
  barriers to participation for marginalized groups. We further highlight obstacles
  that ECRs face when working to promote reform, as well as proposed solutions and
  examples of current best practices. The abstract and recommendations for stakeholders
  are available in Dutch, German, Greek (abstract only), Italian, Japanese, Polish,
  Portuguese, Spanish, and Serbian.
