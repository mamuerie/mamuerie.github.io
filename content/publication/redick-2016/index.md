abstract: Previous research has identified several cognitive abilities that are important
  for multitasking, but few studies have attempted to measure a general multitasking
  ability using a diverse set of multitasks. In the final dataset, 534 young adult
  subjects completed measures of working memory (WM), attention control, fluid intelligence,
  and multitasking. Correlations, hierarchical regression analyses, confirmatory factor
  analyses, structural equation models, and relative weight analyses revealed several
  key findings. First, although the complex tasks used to assess multitasking differed
  greatly in their task characteristics and demands, a coherent construct specific
  to multitasking ability was identified. Second, the cognitive ability predictors
  accounted for substantial variance in the general multitasking construct, with WM
  and fluid intelligence accounting for the most multitasking variance compared to
  attention control. Third, the magnitude of the relationships among the cognitive
  abilities and multitasking varied as a function of the complexity and structure
  of the various multitasks assessed. Finally, structural equation models based on
  a multifaceted model of WM indicated that attention control and capacity fully mediated
  the WM and multitasking relationship. (PsycINFO Database Record
