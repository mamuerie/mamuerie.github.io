abstract: Healthy aging (HA) is associated with certain declines in cognitive functions,
  even in individuals that are free of any process of degenerative illness. Functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely used in order to link this age-related
  cognitive decline with patterns of altered brain function. A consistent finding
  in the fMRI literature is that healthy old adults present higher activity levels
  in some brain regions during the performance of cognitive tasks. This finding is
  usually interpreted as a compensatory mechanism. More recent approaches have focused
  on the study of functional connectivity, mainly derived from resting state fMRI,
  and have concluded that the higher levels of activity coexist with disrupted connectivity.
  In this review, we aim to provide a state-of-the-art description of the usefulness
  and the interpretations of functional brain connectivity in the context of HA. We
  first give a background that includes some basic aspects and methodological issues
  regarding functional connectivity. We summarize the main findings and the cognitive
  models that have been derived from task-activity studies, and we then review the
  findings provided by resting-state functional connectivity in HA. Finally, we suggest
  some future directions in this field of research. A common finding of the studies
  included is that older subjects present reduced functional connectivity compared
  to young adults. This reduced connectivity affects the main brain networks and explains
  age-related cognitive alterations. Remarkably, the default mode network appears
  as a highly compromised system in HA. Overall, the scenario given by both activity
  and connectivity studies also suggests that the trajectory of changes during task
  may differ from those observed during resting-state. We propose that the use of
  complex modeling approaches studying effective connectivity may help to understand
  context-dependent functional reorganizations in the aging process.
