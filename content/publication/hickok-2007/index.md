abstract: Despite decades of research, the functional neuroanatomy of speech processing
  has been difficult to characterize. A major impediment to progress may have been
  the failure to consider task effects when mapping speech-related processing systems.
  We outline a dual-stream model of speech processing that remedies this situation.
  In this model, a ventral stream processes speech signals for comprehension, and
  a dorsal stream maps acoustic speech signals to frontal lobe articulatory networks.
  The model assumes that the ventral stream is largely bilaterally organized--although
  there are important computational differences between the left- and right-hemisphere
  systems--and that the dorsal stream is strongly left-hemisphere dominant.
