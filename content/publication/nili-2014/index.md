abstract: Neuronal population codes are increasingly being investigated with multivariate
  pattern-information analyses. A key challenge is to use measured brain-activity
  patterns to test computational models of brain information processing. One approach
  to this problem is representational similarity analysis (RSA), which characterizes
  a representation in a brain or computational model by the distance matrix of the
  response patterns elicited by a set of stimuli. The representational distance matrix
  encapsulates what distinctions between stimuli are emphasized and what distinctions
  are de-emphasized in the representation. A model is tested by comparing the representational
  distance matrix it predicts to that of a measured brain region. RSA also enables
  us to compare representations between stages of processing within a given brain
  or model, between brain and behavioral data, and between individuals and species.
  Here, we introduce a Matlab toolbox for RSA. The toolbox supports an analysis approach
  that is simultaneously data- and hypothesis-driven. It is designed to help integrate
  a wide range of computational models into the analysis of multichannel brain-activity
  measurements as provided by modern functional imaging and neuronal recording techniques.
  Tools for visualization and inference enable the user to relate sets of models to
  sets of brain regions and to statistically test and compare the models using nonparametric
  inference methods. The toolbox supports searchlight-based RSA, to continuously map
  a measured brain volume in search of a neuronal population code with a specific
  geometry. Finally, we introduce the linear-discriminant t value as a measure of
  representational discriminability that bridges the gap between linear decoding analyses
  and RSA. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the toolbox, we apply it to
  both simulated and real fMRI data. The key functions are equally applicable to other
  modalities of brain-activity measurement. The toolbox is freely available to the
  community under an open-source license agreement (http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/methods-and-resources/toolboxes/license/).
