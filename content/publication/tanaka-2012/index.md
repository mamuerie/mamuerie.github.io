abstract: BACKGROUND  Fatigue can be classified as mental and physical depending on
  its cause, and each type of fatigue has a multi-factorial nature. We examined the
  effect of mental fatigue on the central nervous system using electroencephalography
  (EEG) in eighteen healthy male volunteers.  METHODS  After enrollment, subjects
  were randomly assigned to two groups in a single-blinded, crossover fashion to perform
  two types of mental fatigue-inducing experiments. Each experiment consisted of four
  30-min fatigue-inducing 0- or 2-back test sessions and two evaluation sessions performed
  just before and after the fatigue-inducing sessions. During the evaluation session,
  the participants were assessed using EEG. Eleven electrodes were attached to the
  head skin, from positions F3, Fz, F4, C3, Cz, C4, P3, Pz, P4, O1, and O2.  RESULTS  In
  the 2-back test, the beta power density on the Pz electrode and the alpha power
  densities on the P3 and O2 electrodes were decreased, and the theta power density
  on the Cz electrode was increased after the fatigue-inducing mental task sessions.
  In the 0-back test, no electrodes were altered after the fatigue-inducing sessions.  CONCLUSIONS  Different
  types of mental fatigue produced different kinds of alterations of the spontaneous
  EEG variables. Our findings provide new perspectives on the neural mechanisms underlying
  mental fatigue.
