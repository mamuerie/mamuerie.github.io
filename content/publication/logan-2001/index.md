abstract: "A theory of executive control is presented that proposes that executive
  processes control subordinate processes by manipulating their parameters, reconfiguring
  them to respond in accord with the current task set. It adopts C. Bundesen's (1990)
  theory of visual attention (TVA) and R. M. Nosofsky and T. J. Palmeri's (1997) exemplar-based
  random walk (EBRW) as the theory of subordinate processes. It assumes that a task
  set is a set of TVA and EBRW parameters sufficient to perform a task and that set
  switching involves changing those parameters. The theory solves 2 computational
  problems that emerge in dual-task situations: the binding problem and the serial
  order problem. It can perform dual tasks in series or in parallel but prefers the
  serial strategy because it is faster and it solves the binding problem naturally.
  The theory accounts for concurrence cost, set-switching cost, crosstalk between
  tasks, and the modulation of crosstalk by task set."
