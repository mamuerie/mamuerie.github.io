abstract: Focusing of attention is influenced by external features such as the presence
  of global or local target stimuli, but also by motivation and mood states. In the
  current study, we examined whether working on cognitively demanding tasks for 2
  h, which induces mental fatigue, subsequently had a differential effect on global
  and local processing. The results showed that, compared to non-fatigued participants,
  fatigued participants particularly displayed compromised local processing. This
  indicates that mental fatigue may also manifest itself as effects on attentional
  focusing. The findings of this study are in line with recent ideas about the nature
  of fatigue-related cognitive deficits, implying disturbances in the control over
  attention and behaviour.
