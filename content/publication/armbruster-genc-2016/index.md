abstract: 'UNLABELLED  Recent research yielded the intriguing conclusion that, in
  healthy adults, higher levels of variability in neuronal processes are beneficial
  for cognitive functioning. Beneficial effects of variability in neuronal processing
  can also be inferred from neurocomputational theories of working memory, albeit
  this holds only for tasks requiring cognitive flexibility. However, cognitive stability,
  i.e., the ability to maintain a task goal in the face of irrelevant distractors,
  should suffer under high levels of brain signal variability. To directly test this
  prediction, we studied both behavioral and brain signal variability during cognitive
  flexibility (i.e., task switching) and cognitive stability (i.e., distractor inhibition)
  in a sample of healthy human subjects and developed an efficient and easy-to-implement
  analysis approach to assess BOLD-signal variability in event-related fMRI task paradigms.
  Results show a general positive effect of neural variability on task performance
  as assessed by accuracy measures. However, higher levels of BOLD-signal variability
  in the left inferior frontal junction area result in reduced error rate costs during
  task switching and thus facilitate cognitive flexibility. In contrast, variability
  in the same area has a detrimental effect on cognitive stability, as shown in a
  negative effect of variability on response time costs during distractor inhibition.
  This pattern was mirrored at the behavioral level, with higher behavioral variability
  predicting better task switching but worse distractor inhibition performance. Our
  data extend previous results on brain signal variability by showing a differential
  effect of brain signal variability that depends on task context, in line with predictions
  from computational theories.  SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT  Recent neuroscientific research
  showed that the human brain signal is intrinsically variable and suggested that
  this variability improves performance. Computational models of prefrontal neural
  networks predict differential effects of variability for different behavioral situations
  requiring either cognitive flexibility or stability. However, this hypothesis has
  so far not been put to an empirical test. In this study, we assessed cognitive flexibility
  and cognitive stability, and, besides a generally positive effect of neural variability
  on accuracy measures, we show that neural variability in a prefrontal brain area
  at the inferior frontal junction is differentially associated with performance:
  higher levels of variability are beneficial for the effectiveness of task switching
  (cognitive flexibility) but detrimental for the efficiency of distractor inhibition
  (cognitive stability).'
