abstract: Responses in the second of two subsequently performed tasks can speed up
  compatible responses in the temporally preceding first task. Such backward crosstalk
  effects (BCEs) represent a challenge to the assumption of serial processing in stage
  models of human information processing, because they indicate that certain features
  of the second response have to be represented before the first response is emitted.
  Which of these features are actually relevant for BCEs is an open question, even
  though identifying these features is important for understanding the nature of parallel
  and serial response selection processes in dual-task performance. Motivated by effect-based
  models of action control, we show in three experiments that the BCE to a considerable
  degree reflects features of intended action effects, although features of the response
  proper (or response-associated kinesthetic feedback) also seem to play a role. These
  findings suggest that the codes of action effects (or action goals) can become activated
  simultaneously rather than serially, thereby creating BCEs.
