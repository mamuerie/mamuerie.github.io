abstract: We investigated the impact of mental fatigue on exploration in a complex
  computer task. The exploration behavior of participants who underwent a fatigue
  manipulation (N = 36) was compared with that of a control (nonfatigued) group (N
  = 32). A distinction was also made between participants with high or low levels
  of general computer experience. Results showed that fatigued participants used significantly
  less systematic exploration and made more errors than did nonfatigued participants.
  Fatigued participants with low computer experience also showed significantly more
  rigid behavior than did the other participants. No differences were found on the
  number of subtasks solved. Compared with low-experience participants, highly experienced
  participants showed significantly more systematic exploration, less unsystematic
  trial and error, solved more subtasks, and made fewer errors (marginally significant
  p = .056). Findings were interpreted as the result of reduced task engagement under
  fatigue and reduced involvement of executive control on behavior. Actual or potential
  applications of this research include guidelines to prevent detrimental effects
  of mental fatigue on exploration behavior.
