  abstract = {Previous research has shown that individuals differ with respect to their preferred strategies in self-organized multitasking: They either prefer to work on one task for long sequences before switching to another (blocking), prefer to switch repeatedly after short sequences (switching), or prefer to respond almost simultaneously after processing the stimuli of two concurrently visible tasks (response grouping). In two experiments, we tested to what extent the choice of strategy and related differences in multitasking efficiency were affected by the between-resource competition (Wickens, 2002) of two tasks to be performed concurrently in a self-organized manner. All participants performed a set of dual tasks that differed with respect to the kind of stimuli (verbal vs. spatial) and/or responses (manual vs. vocal). The choice of strategy was hardly affected as most individuals persisted in their response strategy independent of the degree of resource competition. However, the efficiency of individuals preferring a switching or response-grouping strategy increased especially when the reduction in resource competition was response related (manual vs. vocal), leading even to considerable dual-tasking benefits under these circumstances. In contrast, individuals who preferred to block their responses did not achieve any considerable benefits (or costs) with either of the different dual tasks.

  abstract = {Performing high-quality research is a challenging endeavor, especially for early career researchers (ECRs) in many fields of psychological science. Most research is characterized by experiential learning, which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and frustrating. While most institutions provide selected resources to help researchers with their projects, these resources are often expensive, spread out, hard to find, and difficult to compare with one another in terms of reliability, validity, usability, and practicability. A comprehensive overview of resources that are useful for researchers in psychological science is missing. To address this issue, we created ARIADNE – a living and interactive resource navigator that helps to use and search a dynamically updated database of resources. This tutorial aims at guiding researchers through a standard research project using ARIADNE along the way. The open access database covers a growing list of resources useful for each step of a research project, ranging from the planning and designing of a study, over the collection and analysis of the data, to the writing and disseminating of findings. We provide 1) a step-by-step guide on how to perform a research project (in the fields of biological psychology and neuroscience as a case example, but with broad application to neighboring fields), and 2) an overview of resources that are useful at different project steps. By explicitly highlighting open access and open-source resources, we level the playing field for researchers from underprivileged countries or institutions, thereby facilitating open, fair, and reproducible research in the psychological sciences.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms underlying increased dual-task costs in the comparison of modality compatible stimulus-response mappings (e.g., visual-manual, auditory-vocal) and modality incompatible mappings (e.g., visual-vocal, auditory-manual) remain elusive. To investigate whether additional control mechanisms are at work in simultaneously processing two modality incompatible mappings, we applied a transfer logic between both types of dual-task mappings in the context of a mental fatigue induction. We expected an increase in dual-task costs for both modality mappings after a fatigue induction with modality compatible tasks. In contrast, we expected an additional, selective increase in modality incompatible dual-task costs after a fatigue induction with modality incompatible tasks. We tested a group of 45young individuals (19-30~years) in an online pre-post design, in which participants were assigned to one of three groups. The two fatigue groups completed a 90-min time-on-task intervention with a dual task comprising either compatible or incompatible modality mappings. The third group paused for 90~min as a passive control group. Pre and post-session contained single and dual tasks in both modality mappings for all participants. In addition to behavioral performance measurements, seven subjective items (effort, focus, subjective fatigue, motivation, frustration, mental and physical capacity) were analyzed. Mean dual-task performance during and after the intervention indicated a practice effect instead of the presumed fatigue effect for all three groups. The modality incompatible intervention group showed a selective performance improvement for the modality incompatible mapping but no transfer to the modality compatible dual task. In contrast, the compatible intervention group showed moderately improved performance in both modality mappings. Still, participants reported increased subjective fatigue and reduced motivation after the fatigue intervention. This dynamic interplay of training and fatigue effects suggests that high control demands were involved in the prolonged performance of a modality incompatible dual task, which are separable from modality compatible dual-task demands.},
